<p class="ratingheader">Mazes</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Mazes are like word finds without the literacy requirement. The question
with your basic maze is not whether you have the keen insight and raw
pulsating intelligence to get to the end, it's whether you're going to
be able to fend off sleep and the distractions of cable television. The
proof of this is that there are a number of screen savers available that 
create mazes. Any puzzle created by an idling computer isn't worth
completing. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Crostics</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These are the little puzzles where you answer questions, enter letters
into a numbered grid, and end up with a quote that's usually from Winston
Churchill or Harlan Ellison. These just seemed like too much work to me.
Once I come up with an answer to a clue, I'm done. My directive is complete.
If I were a cigar-smoking, bevested capitalist from a forties-era political
cartoon, I'd have underpaid, possibly illegal servants to cross-enter
my clues. But, against all reason, I'm not. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Picture Find</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These are those "Can you find a picture of a duck, a violin,
Warren G. Harding, and a collection of Grateful Dead bootleg tapes
in this picture of a boy at a fishing hole?" puzzles. My main problem
with them is too much imagination. You can find Warren G. Harding's face
in a bowl of Dinty Moore beef stew if you look hard enough. And
vice versa. So it wasn't a matter of finding a violin. It was finding
the violin the <em>man</em> wants you to find. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Jumble</p>
<p class="ratingbody">After a couple dozen Jumbles, thirty tops, you start to develop
an eerie sixth sense for what the belabored pun at the end is
going to be. <em>Of course</em> the twin buglars are a PAIR of "SNEAKERS,"
and the angry man from Copenhagen is a CHEESED DANISH. You don't
even need to unscramble DORIEP to find out. And after another six
or ten you just don't care. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Which is Different?</p>
<p class="ratingbody">As far as I'm concerned, if two cowboys are dressed exactly alike
except for the shape of their spurs, it's close enough. I don't
feel it's my place to criticize people in period garb for minor
inconsistencies. I went through enough of that the one time I
went to a Rennaisance Fair, I don't wish it on anyone else, even
cartoony cowboy sextuplets. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>
