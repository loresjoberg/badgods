I remember this game from the early 80s, when the video game Centipede
was supernova hot, so hot indeed that Tomy made a stupid little plastic
game with a transparent Centipede theme. Unlike Centipede, in which
you dismember an insect with callous efficiency, Catch a Caterpillar
challenges you to <EM>assemble</EM> an insect from individual insect
pieces, also known as "BBs," making the game more like a combination
of Cootie and Gothic horror than a video game.  According to the
instructions, you "release shooter to fire, aiming into center opening,"
which sounds great except you can't actually aim. You just shoot one BB
after another, hoping the mysterious power of magnetism will cause them
to stick together. <B>D</B></P></TD>

This belongs to one of my favorite Tomy Game subgenera, the "annoying
buzz" group of games. You set a timer and the game makes what I'm
tempted to describe as a nasal rattling, in spite of the fact that
the game does not actually have a nose. Except, of course, for the
painted nose of the dragon you have to avoid along with his friends
the evil plush spider, the evil vaguely-amused-looking skull, and
the evil happy pile of excrement. You have to get your intrepid
adventurer, also known as a "BB," past these dangers and to the safety
of what is either a castle or a small mob of gnomes before the rattling
stops, or else your adventurer is held in place by the still-mysterious
if increasingly commonplace power of magnetism. <B>D</B></P></TD>

In another uncannily realistic simulation, this game puts you behind the
controls of a helicopter with the ability to shoot short-range air-to-air 
BBs at another helicopter that's just sitting there doing nothing. As
in real life, each direct hit causes the enemy helicopter to move forward
a small distance, except for the 8th, which makes it explode. I hear
the army is seeking out Copter Fight experts for recruitment into its
elite helicopter units. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

"A real test of skill for more advanced Pocket game players," this
game's instructions warn. I burn with envy that I cannot call myself
an advanced Pocket Game player. This game, which is both dull and awkward --
although perhaps that's just because I'm not advanced enough -- emulates
the dull and awkward game of golf. Each of nine "holes" is created
by rotating the little golfy landscape they have set up for you, which
is kind of clever at the same time that it doesn't actually improve
the game, which is essentially low-budget Pachinko with a pastoral theme.  <B>D-</B></P></TD>

This allows you to fulfill the universal dream of randomly assembling
modular robots. It's kind of like those kids' books where you can flip
pages to put a penguin's head on a walrus's body, except that the results
here are essentially random and not at all amusing. You get points
for certain combinations, and if you can get 100 or more points in ten spins,
you're a "Robotics Expert." I'm sure you, like all thinking people, would
like to be a Robotics Expert, but don't get your hopes up. The chances of
actually getting 100 points are something less than one in a million. <B>D-</B></P></TD>
