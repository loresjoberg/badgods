<p class="ratingheader">A Plush Frog</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The frog is red, white, and blue, because it's a national political
convention. That's such an obvious choice it's pathetic. It's like
naming your cat "Fluffy" or your butler "Jeeves." The frog is named
Tad Jr. but he has the word "Boston" on his chest so that eight years
from now when you're saying to yourself "Where in God's name did I
get a tricolor frog?" The answer will be right in front of you. I think
more plush toys should have that feature. I have a handful of stuffed animals
that would say "One of Those Claw Games at a Denny's You Went to Drunk." <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">A Pink Razor</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I didn't go to the DNC myself, and the guy who sent me the packet,
Dave Barker, is a male guy, not a female guy, so I'm not sure if this
is some sort of gender mismatch or if there's some connection between
the Democratic National Convention and pink personal care products. I
imagine Ann Coulter could think up about six. The thing I like about this
is that it's called a "Passion Venus." I'm glad we've reached the point
in society where all feminine products have names like silicone vibrators. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">A Pad of Paper</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This is nice paper, but it has "Crane's" -- the manufacturer's name --
at the top of every page. I've had an aversion to using products with
overly prominent trademarks on them since a bad experience with a Le Car
in 1983.  It also has the history of the company written on the inside
of the cover, so it doubles as a way to get really bored. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Macaroni and Cheese</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Kraft plays both sides in the political game, distributing boxes of mac
and cheese at both major conventions, the Democrats getting donkey shapes
and the Republicans getting elephant shapes. Maybe they have a Libertarian
version with little guns and copies of <cite>Atlas Shrugged,</cite> I'm
not sure. At any rate, this is just the sort of political favor-buying
that needs to be eradicated in this country. Whoever ends up in the White
House, we know who will be calling the shots in the arena of global
cheesiness issues. If the next administration establishes national
cholesterol minimums, we'll know who to blame. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">A Coupon</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad to know our political representatives can take comfort and
solace from five free digital prints at CVS pharmacy. At 29 cents each,
that's a big buck forty-five worth of freedom. These are the things
that make us a beacon unto the world. You know how many free prints
government representatives in Syria get? Well, pretty much all they want,
it's a totalitarian state. But they're dark, somber digital prints,
color-balanced by the forces of oppression and sent to the printer of 
tyranny via the USB cable of non-representative rulership. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>
