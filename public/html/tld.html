This supposedly stands for "commercial," but some of the earliest .coms
I ran into were Santa Cruz geek houses, so obviously people are paying
no more attention to that guideline than to the one that suggests you
only use Q-tips to wash around the outside of your ear. Even now, being
told your .com of choice is unavailable and being offered a .org or .net
instead is like going to the movies and finding out the air conditioning
is busted. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.net</SPAN><BR>
As time goes on, the pointlessness of the .net TLD approaches infinity.
By definition, any agency which is applying for a domain name either has
or is attempting to establish an online presence, making this domain something
like having a special pilot's license for those who actually want to go
up in the air. This has become nothing more than a second-choice domain,
so let's say "net" stands for "Nuts! Everything's Taken" and move on. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.org</SPAN><BR>
A TLD with a proud and honorable history, housing such inimitable
sites as <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot.org</A> and <A HREF="http://www.userfriendly.org">userfriendly.org</A>. Both of these recently
stopped being non-profit organizations and are now commercial, though,
underscoring the problems of trying to establish definitions in this
topsy-turvy, helter-skelter, willy-nilly, artsy-fartsy, champaign-urbana,
ralston-purina world. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.edu</SPAN><BR>
At long last, a domain name with some standards! Only four-year accredited
American universities can hook one of these puppies. As much as I appreciate
knowing what to expect, the waste of namespace makes me wonder whether we
shouldn't open it up to community colleges, vocational schools, karate dojos
and that one art school where you have to draw a pirate to get in. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.gov</SPAN><BR>
If I were a government leader in any country other than the US, I'd
be peeved and grumpy. In Internet terms, the USA is not just <EM>a</EM>
gov, but <EM>the</EM> gov? Is this some sort of hint? A shadow of the 
future global hegemony that fundamentalists and eco-terrorists keep going
off about? Or -- and this is my guess -- a reflection of the fact that
you have to punch Americans in the arm just to get them to remember that
other countries exist? <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.mil</SPAN><BR>
Same problem as with .gov, only more disturbing. I vote that we fold this
into .gov and free the .mil TLD up for persons and organizations having to
do with milk. Wouldn't that be fun? <B>D</B></P>
