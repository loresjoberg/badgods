Hey, it's little dead birds! For all your little dead bird needs! Granted,
they were never little live birds, but they're covered in actual
bird feathers and if you put them on their sides the resemblance is
remarkable. Apparently you're intended to strap them to various crafts against humanity in order to give them that breezy dead-bird-festooned
air that really moves the wicker at the downtown arts fair. <B>B-</B></P></TD>

Am I the only one who reads the phrase "a surprise for a girl" and thinks
"missed period"? Well, this pink-encrusted bag contains something much
<EM>better</EM> than a missed period: tootsie rolls, a plastic house filled with
"ponyholders" and plastic rings, and an inexplicable little plastic ghost
with a hole in the top of his head. While nothing in the bag was actually
surprising in any useful sense, I <EM>was</EM> taken aback somewhat by
the word "ponyholder." <B>C</B></P></TD>

I include this just to point out that you can sometimes find brand-name
stuff in a dollar store, if you're willing to limit yourself to 
colors that went out of style about the time Tiffany fell off
the charts. But this <EM>is</EM> actual Play-Doh, not some thinly-veiled rip-off
with a name like "Playful-Dough." And it's still moist and still smells like
something you should really at least <EM>try</EM> to eat. Remarkable. <B>A</B></P></TD>

After several people wrote in to tell me that they do in fact use 
dental mirrors on themselves -- apparently having enough interest in
the far reaches of their own mouth crannies to rig up a double-mirror
solution -- I'm reluctant to declare any commercial item useless. Having
said that, this is useless. If you sort your paper bags by size and hang
them from the wall on a device too narrow to hold more than five or six
of each size, stop it. What you're doing is wrong. <B>D</B></P></TD>

Ah, the perennial dollar store favorite: crappy books nobody wants based
on crappy moves nobody saw. In this case the beginning of the book
is set in a store filled with stupid crap nobody wants, lending the
whole affair an interesting recursive quality that doesn't reduce
the crappiness one bit. Warning: contains the sentence "Before they
knew it, they were involved in a kiss that lit the future." <B>D-</B></P></TD>
