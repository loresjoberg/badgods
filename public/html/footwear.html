<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Army Boots</SPAN><BR>
"Your mother wears army boots" is no longer the insult it used
to be, owing to the increasing acceptance of functional footwear
for both sexes. In an ideal world, this insult would be replaced by
"Your mother wears stiletto heels which impede mobility, destroy
arch support and are an unflattering shade of red." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tennis Shoes </SPAN><BR>
The airsoles and the flashing lights and the celebrity
endorsements are what get all the attention, but what impresses me
most about them is the vast improvements in tread design we've
seen over the past couple of decades. Tennis shoe treads now
incorporate all sorts of freaky expressionist art. If only the
waffle iron makers had the courage to follow suit. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flip-Flops</SPAN><BR>
Also known as zories, wedgies, jellies, thongs and Jerusalem
crickets, these have the advantage that they're easy to slip
on your feet on the way to the beach, and the disadvantage
that they're designed only for walking in one direction at a 
moderate pace. Try and pull of a mambo in these things and they'll
be called "soaring projectiles." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Platform Shoes</SPAN><BR>
At six-foot-four I'd no sooner wear platform shoes than an artificial
nose extension, but if you want to give it a shot, go for it. Then you
can see what it's like to bump your head in airplane bathrooms and
on hanging decorations in festive Mexican restaurants. Then you can
see what it's like to have everyone assume that if there's something
on the top of the fridge that needs reaching, you're the one who's going
to do it. Then you can see what it's like to never be protected by crowds
from viewing street performance.  <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fuzzy Slippers </SPAN><BR>
Fuzzy slippers and terrycloth bathrobes are the little things that
make it possible to survive the long walk from the bedroom to the
coffee machine. And if they're in the shape of some sort of animal 
or animal part, so much the better. There's nothing like putting your foot
in a rabbit to start the day off right. <B>A</B></P>
