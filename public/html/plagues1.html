<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frogs</SPAN><BR>
Normally you wouldn't expect a plague of frogs to convince
Pharaoh to let the cat out, much less free thousands of slaves,
but imagine this: you wake up one morning, get out of
bed and -- SPLORCH -- step on a frog. Freshly dead amphibian
ichor between your toes <EM>first thing in the morning.</EM>
Pretty <EM>icky,</EM> huh? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Locusts</SPAN><BR>
Not bad. Locusts are horrid little insects, plus they eat crops.
It's two great plagues that plague great together. One wonders,
though, if the frogs ate locusts or if the two plagues had a truce
like that time G.I. Joe and Cobra had to team up to fight
a common enemy. Didn't think I'd be able to work 80's cartoon
shows into this one, did you? <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Blood</SPAN><BR>
A river of blood. Creepy. But in the end it sounds better than, say, a
river of motor oil, syringes and abandoned shopping carts. At least blood
is organic. Still I can see how when you've got a majorly river-based
economy going, it could be difficult to make a transition to a massive
blood-flow economy. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hail</SPAN><BR>
This is about when you realize you really are dealing with
God and not just tough luck and weird weather patterns. Hail,
okay, fine, you just do the ancient Egyptian equivalent of 
rolling up the car windows. But fire <EM>and</EM> hail in tandem
is a big-ass clue that perhaps you're dealing with the chosen
people and maybe you should just let them go and build your
own damn stone monuments. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Death of Cattle</SPAN><BR>
It's pretty tough to rationalize what the cattle did to
deserve the celestial smackdown. But admittedly that's a revisionist,
post-<CITE>Babe</CITE> take on the situation. The Big Guy was never big
on animal rights, what with the scapegoats and fatted calves and such.
He am that he am, pardner, cows or no cows. <B>D+</B></P>
