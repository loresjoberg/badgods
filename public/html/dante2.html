<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Wrathful</SPAN><BR>
The punishment for the wrathful is to attack each other. Is it just me
or is this a briar-patch sort of "punishment"? If you're really wrathful,
you're probably going to dig on a chance to work out that anger by gouging
others. It's like punishing gluttons with ice cream sandwiches. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Sullen</SPAN><BR>
Sullen? Sullenness is a sin? The sort of sin that dooms you to spend
eternity in a slime-pit? Now I'm worried. How about crankiness? Poutiness?
Irascibility?  My God, what if <EM>irony</EM> is a sin? Yeah, I'd certainly be
overjoyed to find <EM>that</EM> out. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Heretics</SPAN><BR>
People in tombs writhe in flames, pretty standard. It's nice to finally
see some flames in Hell, I'd hate to think that all those Far Side
cartoons had no basis in reality. The odd bit here is that these souls
are a sub-genus of "The Violent," because they did violence to God by
denying immortality. I'm not sure how that's, technically speaking,
violent. But that's God for you, the all-huffy. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Violent Against Neighbors</SPAN><BR>
Now this is what I call violent. People who, you know, hit people.
These malcontents are doomed to wallow in a boiling river of blood, and if
they stop wallowing in blood they get shot by centaurs.  But hey,
at least they get a choice. If the boiling blood gets dull, they can
give the centaur pincushion thing a try for a while. Hey, it's Hell,
what do you want, doilies and candy jars? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Suicides</SPAN><BR>
Suicides get their souls trapped in trees which bleed when harpies eat
them. Take that, "Theme from M*A*S*H"! Anyhow, the suicides can only
speak while bleeding, but that doesn't seem like it would make much
of a difference. What are you going to talk about, it's not like there's
a game on. "So, still trapped in a tree made of Purina Harpy Chow, huh? Yeah,
me too. Ow." <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Blasphemers</SPAN><BR>
Burning sand and rains of fire, all for those who said things like
"Jesus fuck, that's one God-be-buggered big-ass fajita plate," plus
the entire London cast of Jesus Christ Superstar. It doesn't
make it clear whether you can get away with phrases like "Gosh darn
cripes," which would have been good to know. Anyhow, if you do these
things you have to lay down in the sand. I think it would have been
a more appropriate punishment for evil sunbathers, but that's why
I'm not Pope. Among other reasons. <B>C</B></P>
