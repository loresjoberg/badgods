<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><I>Struthio Camelus</I></SPAN><BR>
This was completely unfair. In order to even get this, you had
to know first that in "Joust" one of the players rides
an ostrich, and secondly that <I>Struthio Camelus</I> is
the scientific name for a common species of ostrich. I'm sure
there are about three ornithologist video game enthusiasts
out there who thought this was hilarious, but really now... <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shirley Jones</SPAN><BR>
On the other hand, I make no apologies for references to
TV stars from the Seventies. From Leather Tuscadero to
Marshall, Will and Holly, if they've got feathered hair and a penchant
for the word "groovy," they're going to end up here  sooner or
later. So if you don't recognize the sacred name of the Partridge Matriarch,
you may want to take a remedial class or something. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ziggurat</SPAN><BR>
Okay, so technically the tower in Q*bert isn't a ziggurat,
partly because the little ridges don't go all around, and
partly because Q*bert isn't technically Mesopotamian. But
if the Mesopotamians spent less time creating the oldest legal code
preserved in its entirety and more time hopping around avoiding purple snakes,
I'm willing to bet the two would look eerily similar. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jet Engine Testing Cannons</SPAN><BR>
These, for those of you not "in the hip" about such things, are
devices which shoot dead chickens at powered-up jet engines under
controlled circumstances in order to determine whether said engines
can survive the impact, the chicken's survival being a moot point.
There's a story about inadvertently using frozen chickens which is
too unlikely to reprint here, but it serves to illustrate that
there's actually already a distinguished body of dead chicken cannon
literature out there, of which this space is only a small part.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">'74 Dodge Dart</SPAN><BR>
This may shock some of the faithful, but I actually
have no idea how prone to oil leaks Dodge Darts are. I had
a friend who had a lot of trouble with hers, though,
and "Dodge Dart" is a funny name (and good advice, when you think about it)
so rather than spend time going through maintenance history for hundreds
of American cars, I just went with it. I'd say I used the time saved
to create new and better comedy for your daily consumption, but
actually I made a grilled cheese sandwich and took
a "test your kissability" quiz in <I>YM</I>. <B>C</B></P>
