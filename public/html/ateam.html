Can anyone out there tell me exactly which semester of Abnormal
Psychology covers dumb accents and bad celebrity impersonations? If&nbsp;--&nbsp;as
Murdock's case seems to imply&nbsp;--&nbsp;this is a legitimate syndrome requiring
hospitalization, we may have finally tracked down the long-suspected but
never-proven link between President Reagan's deregulation of the mental
health industry and the rise of stand-up comedy in the 80's. If only
we could have <EM>helped</EM> these people instead of giving them six minutes on
"Live at the Improv." <B>C+</B></P></TD>

Watch the intro for the first season. Each team member is given a
short montage showing him doing what he does best. Hannibal dresses
up as different people, Murdock acts weird and pilots some sort of
aircraft. Mr. T kicks ass and chews bubble gum. And Face? Face smiles a
lot and takes off a pair of glasses. Now if the team was trapped in the
arctic and had to vote which person to gut and crawl inside for warmth,
who do you think would get the most black marbles? That's right, the one
whose main talent is comparison shopping for tooth whitener. The lesson
here? If you're going to name yourself after a body part, make it one
you can hit people with. <B>D</B></P></TD>

The great thing about Mr. T is that he managed to be everywhere without
having any discernable impact on fashion outside of vinyl Halloween
outfits and that one episode of Diff'rent Strokes. There were a lot
of fashion mistakes made in the 80s, most of them involving headbands,
but somehow the whole mohawk-and-beard, twenty-pounds-of-gold-chains,
athletic-socks-over-pantlegs thing never caught on. Anyhow, Mr. T was
and is the cornerstone of the A-Team franchise. Without him, the show
might as well have been titled "Three White Guys Get Cancelled." <B>A</B></P></TD>

Disguises are a great, time-honored if not entirely believable
part of the action-spy genre. My question is, though, why does Hannibal
bother wearing these elaborate disguises when nobody else does? What's
the point of covering your moles and putting on a fake moustache when
you can be reliably spotted by your proximity to Mr. T? You'd think that
if you were on the run from the military and needed to remain incognito
at all costs, "A selection of wigs" would come lower on the list than
"Don't hang out with the one guy who stands out as a massively muscular
eccentric even in LA." <B>C</B></P></TD>

Actually, there were two girls, The Girl From the First Season and The
Girl From the Second Season. They were there to fill the incredibly
important narrative role of being the girl. Many people blame Hollywood
for creating this archestereotype, but actually it goes back to the
earliest Greek theater, in such productions as "Promethus Unbound and
Tiffany" and "The Frogs and Tiffany." Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax! <B>D</B></P></TD>
