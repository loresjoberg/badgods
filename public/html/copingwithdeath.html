<p class="ratingheader">Denial</p>
<p class="ratingbody">It's a shame you can't ride this one out right up to the end. When
I'm lying in bed at night and I'm suddenly clenched in the grip
of the terrible knowledge of my own inevitable mortality, my
usual coping mechanism is to assume I'm going to get hit by a bus.
Assuming the bus driver is competent enough to kill me instantly,
that relieves me of any need to acknowledge the possibility that
I might not live to see Alpha Centauri colonized or leg warmers
come back into fashion. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Anger</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Perfectly understandable for the corpse-in-training, but this
has got to be a big pain for various loved ones, caretakers,
and pharmacists. Not only is the sickie in question acting
like a big jerk, propriety keeps those in attendance from
saying "Look. Do us all a favor. Lay down, shut up, and metastasize."</p>

<p class="ratingbody">"Do not go gently into that good night" sounds
all well and good when you're popping by to get some poetic
inspiration, but I imagine at some point most of the survivors
would like the dying person to at least go, if not gently, then
at least reasonably politely. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Bargaining</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Is this the right word? "Bargaining," to me, implies a sort of
back-and-forth negotation. This stage, instead, involves paying unlicensed
medical practitioners to do a song-and-dance involving chicken blood and
speaking in tongues, and/or desperately performing the sorts of nice, pious
neighborly acts you probably should have been doing all along.</p>

<p class="ratingbody">While I find a certain amount of
inexplicable charm in the idea of God saying "Look, you want this
brain tumor in remission, and I want to give you that. I really
do. But you're going to have to do better than a couple bags of
canned goods," I think the more precise term for this stage is
"Grasping at straws." <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Depression</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Also understandable. Hell, in this day and age any perfectly
healthy person with access to cable television has a right
to be depressed. The knowledge that in a short while you're
going to be pushing up neatly cropped cemetary grass while those you
love get to go on having ice cream and picking out new sweaters
and--worst of all--eventually getting over your death, well
even the thought of it is getting me sort of down.</p>

<p class="ratingbody">Hint to photographers bucking for a Pulitzer:
this is the best stage to get your shots in. The slack jaw
and air of resignation, the concerned, hand-patting family,
the neatly tucked sheets--it's <em>pure gold, baby</em>! <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Acceptance</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad to see that this is the final stage. It would be a bummer
if "Acceptance" was followed by "Regret" or "Karaoke." As it is,
though, your archetypical bucket-kicker gets to spend his or her
last few days or hours or picoseconds appreciating birdsong and
working on a catchy tombstone motto. They still end up equally dead,
though. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>
