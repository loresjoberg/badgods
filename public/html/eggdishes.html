<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Omelets</SPAN><BR>
I like food with interchangeable ingredients. It's like the
culinary equivalent of Legos, only it hurts less
when you pull it apart with your teeth. Omelets score big
points on this front, because most breakfast places give you
a big list of crap you can have folded into that bad boy, and
often you'll run into some weird item you'd never have considered.
Dijon mustard? Cottage cheese? Fatback? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Devilled</SPAN><BR>
Hard-boiled eggs, as I've mentioned previously, are not my cup on
animal protein. But it's a proud tradition of my Arkie heritage that
there's nothing that can't be improved with some mayonnaise, and that
everything looks fancy with paprika sprinkled on it. Thus, the devilled
egg. It also works if you just toss out the yolk and fill the egg
cavity with aerosol cheese. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fried</SPAN><BR>
It's a sign of my increasing maturity that if I break the yolk on
my fried eggs I no longer go into a week-long depression. A big help
in this direction was getting over my sense of inferiority to
Denny's short order cooks. I realized that the reason I never get
a broken yolk at a restaurant is because the cooks can trash any
failures. For all I know, it took a carton of eggs for the cook
to get me a perfect pair of fried eggs. Two cartons if I ordered
the Extra Slam. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scrambled</SPAN><BR>
I dunno, scrambled eggs don't, you know, do it for me. They're so
homogeneous. I always end up adding onions and garlic and cheese and
whatnot to them, and at that point you've basically made an omelet you
stir. As excuses to pull out the Tabasco go, they're okay, but
nothing to send the pastor email about. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coddled</SPAN><BR>
I like coddled eggs. I didn't know what they were until ten minutes ago,
but I liked them already. It just sounds good. It's nice to live in
a society so luxurious that we can coddle our breakfast dishes. I think
we should go all the way and make mollycoddled eggs. Nothing's too good
for our eggs. <B>C+</B></P>
