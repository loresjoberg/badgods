<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Vulcan Ears</SPAN><BR>
Spock ears may be the driving force behind the Trek phenomenon. Roddenberry
apparently tapped into one of the strongest symbols in the Universal Geek
Unconscious. Somewhere in the back of the mind of every D&amp;D-playing
junior-high-schooler is the equation "pointy ears = cool." Elves, Vulcans,
Yoda, six-breasted Cat Women -- wherever you find dweeby wish-fulfillment,
you find pointy ears. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bajoran Nose Ridges</SPAN><BR>
Man, they weren't even <EM>trying</EM> with this one. I don't know if they
were running out of latex or what, but boldly going where people look like
they're about to go cross-eyed is not my idea of majestic space opera. Coming
soon -- aliens with extra-deep upper lip dents. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Klingon Forehead Ridges</SPAN><BR>
I've heard rumors that the Klingon term for forehead ridges is "flavor curls,"
but I doubt that we're getting confirmation on that one anytime soon. I'm sure 
the Klingons took home the "Most Improved Makeup" award at the Implausible
Aliens Convention, but they never <EM>did</EM> explain how they got to their
present impressive state from the original series, where on the special
effects scale they rated slightly below "Endora turns Darren into a mule."

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Andorian Antennae</SPAN><BR>
Yeah, I realize even acknowledging the existence of Andorian antennae
pegs me as Signori Molti di Geekland, but that's the price you
pay for thoroughness. To my credit, I don't know what purpose the
antennae supposedly serve, but I imagine it had something to do with
natural selection, early in the Andorians' evolution, for lifeforms
that looked completely fakey. This also accounts for the blue skin
and the Caesar-cum-Sno-Balls hairdo. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cardassian Neck Cables</SPAN><BR>
There's something really stylish about the Cardassians with their 
suspension-bridge necks and Trainspotting-meets-Transylvania sunken
eyes, the entire look conspiring to say "I was assembled from an
Erector Set and I may destroy you at any moment." Overall I never really
dug the Cardassians -- the Borg could have assimilated their asses faster 
than you can say "Mr. Tambourine Man" -- but the look was there. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ferengi Teeth</SPAN><BR>
I know the ears and foreheads are supposed to be the attraction here --
how novel for a Star Trek alien -- but I'm always fascinated by the
Ferengi's teeth. All other races in the galaxy seem to have discovered
corrective orthodontia and no-copayment dental plans; the Ferengi
alone dare to keep their teeth looking like Stonehenge on mescaline.
Considering even the warrior-class Klingons must be flossing,
this is an admirable resistance to inter-species peer pressure. <B>B</B></P>
