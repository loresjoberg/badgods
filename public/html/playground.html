<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Slides</SPAN><BR>
Slides are great, except the ones made out of Frictionium, the mysterious
metal with a friction coefficent that makes concrete sidewalks look like a
bathtub of baby oil by comparison. With those you don't slide,
you just sit there looking like an idiot on an incline. Unless you're unlucky,
and the slide takes three layers of skin as a sacrifice to the dark gods of
recess. But slides that work, those are the shit: <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Swings</SPAN><BR>
I've noticed an increasing number of newish playgounds with no swings,
or only baby swings.  This is a pity, because whether you want to be
Superman or a fairy princess, when you're a kid all best-case scenarios
involve the power of flight, and swings are about as close as you're
going to get. Some of these parks still have the sumo-pants
baby swings, but in my graham cracker days I was considered something
of an expert in baby-swing use for non-babies, and I can tell you it's
not worth the effort. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tic-Tac-Toe Games</SPAN><BR>
Oh, please. This seems to be what the more litigationally timid
playgrounds are providing in place of swings and other potential
bone-cracking amusements: big plastic dowels with Xs and Os on them
that you can twirl around to play tic-tac-toe. If I wanted to play
a game like some cerebral egghead I'd head home and bust out the
Candyland. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Monkey Bars</SPAN><BR>
It's hard to form an objective opinion on these, because I hate them. They
mock me. Monkey bars are filed in my mind under "things I never quite
mastered," along with kickball and the trombone.  Each effort to span
a monkey-bar chasm ended up with me in the sand, cursing second grade
and vowing to use an as-yet-undiscovered worldwide publishing medium to
wreak my revenge on those who laughed at me. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tractory Sand-Moving Devices</SPAN><BR>
The whole process of moving sand around in a playground is as futile as it
is popular. It's not like some future documentary narrator is going to say
"Center Street Park: a harsh wilderness brought to heel  by generations
of grade-schoolers who labored tirelessly, piling the sand into little
hills." But I like it anyway. It's meditative. The sand was there,
now it's here, and you made it happen. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Merry-Go-Rounds</SPAN><BR>
Centrifugal force! Whee! Nothing like nearly being thrown from a moving
object while the corndog you just ate fights its way to the surface
to justify an afternoon out!  Thus will the merry-go-round remain the
acme of playground self-abuse until someone invents a device to hold you
upside down and shake you like a wet elkhound. <B>C+</B></P>
