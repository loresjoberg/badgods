<p class="ratingheader">August</p>
<p class="ratingbody">When I was a kid, August bugged me. It's the only month, in the US at least,
with no major holidays. Of course, it was summer and I was out of school
anyway, but dammit, I wanted a holiday! Preferably one involving a nice
meal. Cold cuts, maybe. The Feast of Cold Cuts. There you go. Anyhow,
August is also hot and sticky and named after some moldy old Roman, so
really it doesn't get any better the closer you examine it. <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">September</p>
<p class="ratingbody">September, while nicely cool and usually pretty, doesn't really have much going on in the holiday area either,
modulo Rosh Hashanah if you're Jewish. It does have the whole back-to-school
aspect, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand you get various 
cartoon-imprinted folders and pencil sharpeners and such, but on the other hand,
you know, back to school. But now that I'm an adult and I can and do buy a 
Powerpuff Girls lunchbox any time I want, that doesn't bother me anymore. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">October</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Halloween is good. Columbus Day is one of those "holidays" that affect
only postal workers and bank tellers. October is also when the weather starts
settling down into some serious stinkiness or, on the California coast,
intermittent hazy skies. Growing up in California, weather was 
something that happened to other people, like meteor strikes or 
cholera. <span class="ratinggrade">B+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">November</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This is where it all starts; the whole yuletide currency-fest. We should
just consolidate November and December, make up a name in Latin that
refers to credit cards and/or animatronic bears in red hats, and have done
with it. At least November has a feast holiday. But you have to wade through
an oozing tide of holly-bedecked used car salesmen on TV to get to it. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">December</p>
<p class="ratingbody">If the Star Wars series was a year, it would end with The Empire Strikes
Back. It's kind of pretty, but very dark, and it has many exciting parts
but overall it's pretty much a bummer. Jeez, I really hope the rest of the
Matrix trilogy is good so that I can stop making these constant references
to Star Wars. You know how old people are always talking about the
depression and/or World War II? My generation's going to be like that
with Star Wars. We're going to make all these addled references to Bespin 
and Yavin and the youth will hate us for it. But I digress. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">January</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I think having January as the first month of the New Year encourages
cynicism in many people. They get drunk off their ass in the spirit of renewal and
the hope for a bright future, and the next day it's still cold, wet, and
dismal. And that's pretty much what they come to expect from life. Me, I like the rain. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>
