<BR>
<P>In a little over two years, there's going to be a presidential election,
and we'll be forced to trot out the obligatory spoof campaign
("Sj&ouml;berg/Neilsen 2000: They're Not 35, But We Won't Tell If You Don't").
So we figured we'd better start ramping up our platform now if
we don't want to be steamrollered by the powerful 
"Scary/Baby 2000" campaign engine. ("They're Not 
Americans, But We Won't Tell If You Don't")</P>

<P>So here's our first proposal, which will be upgraded to "demand"
if the polls warrant. We want warning labels on our laws. Congress
churns out gobs of laws every year, only a handful of which end up
actually being something we have to pay attention to. In the interest
of freeing up time to play America's National Sport, Foosball (That's
our other proposal), we want congress to add a simple rating to
every law they pass to let us know if we actually have to pay attention.
Some examples:</P>

<P>These are our values. Unless people don't want them to be. But I'm
pretty set on the foosball thing.</P>
