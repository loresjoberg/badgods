<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Captain America</SPAN><BR>
Captain America is cool. And do you know why Captain America is
cool? <EM>Garbage can lids</EM>! The little wings
and the sticky-out ears I can take or leave, but as a child I
discovered that, in a world where web-shooters and batarangs
are tragically difficult to come by, you can fashion a workable
Captain America shield out of a standard round trashcan lid.
And it bruises, too! <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Incredible Hulk</SPAN><BR>
The Hulk has gone through many permutations over the
years -- smart Hulk, nice Hulk, Hulk Hogan -- but the
real appeal lies with big dumb angry Hulk. With intelligence
he's just a less-fiber-conscious Jolly Green Giant, but
the old-style "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry" Hulk says
something about the primal animal within us, about the
transience of rage, and about Bill Bixby's ability to 
look dejected. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Spider-Man</SPAN><BR>
Spider-Man's real power is his ability to attract
great theme songs. From "Slings his web, any size" to "Nobody
knows who you aaaaare!" Spidey has the best tunage this side of
Adam West's minimalist Batman 
ditty. I actually haven't caught the most recent Spider-Man cartoon,
which I assume has one of those drawn-out instrumentals so popular
with the "Animated Adventures" set these days, but even if it
sucks, it can't take away from the glory of such lines as
"Is he strong? Listen, bud/He's got radioactive blood." 
Spider-sense is really cool, too. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thor</SPAN><BR>
As much as I love to endorse the Nordic ("Endorse the Nordic" being
my favorite Dead Can Dance album), and as much as the hammer makes
a nice heroic accessory, there are a few things about The Chippendale
Dancer of Thunder that are less than thrilling. First off, why
was a Norse god talking like the King James Bible? Secondly,
why was it that every third episode someone other than Thor manages to
pick up his hammer, in spite of the mystical security measures,
and Thor reacts like this has never happened to him before in his entire
immortal existence?  And finally, why did he have big blue circles on 
his chest? His torso looked like "Twister for Beginners." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">She-Hulk</SPAN><BR>
In the halcyon days of Marvel, which is to say any period where
they published no more than one title beginning with "X-," they
often had trouble coming up with decent female heroes. The ones
that they did have usually just served as portable hostages and
had dialogue that made June Cleaver look like Exene Cervenka.
She-Hulk is a welcome exception to this rule, in spite of
having a name that makes "Ant-Man" look pretty good by comparison.
She kicks four-color butt. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Iron Man</SPAN><BR>
Not bad, not bad. A bit impersonal; even as a kid it's hard to
identify with someone with their head in a bucket, but hey, he's
got repulsor rays. Rays are good things to have. The thing of it,
and you're probably way ahead of me on this one, is that every time
I hear the phrase "Iron Man Triathlon," I get the image of some guy in 
red and gold armor pedaling a bike. Don't even get me started 
on "Iron Maiden." <B>B-</B></P>
