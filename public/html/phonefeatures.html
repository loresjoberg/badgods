<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mute</SPAN><BR>
I can't bring myself to trust mute,  no matter how steadfastly the
little red light shines. I've been raised on too many sitcoms not to
expect mute buttons, microphone off switches, and office door locks to
fail whenever it leads to  hilarious levels of social awkwardness. It's
the same reason I don't dress up in a disguise to make sure my girlfriend
isn't cheating on me, only to bungle the attempt and in the process ruin
the surprise party she had planned for my birthday.o <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Redial</SPAN><BR>
This is another  button that can be awkward, because you can hit redial to
invite a friend to catch a movie, but you forgot that you tried to call
your own mother a half-hour ago, and this time she answers the phone,
and you end up asking "who's this?" before realizing what you did, so you
can't play it cool and you didn't want to talk to her right now anyway
and anyway the movie's going to start real soon so you have to tell your
mom you don't want to talk to her or you'll miss the movie and if you're
lucky you'll drop into some sort of coma before you get that far. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Emergency Dial</SPAN><BR>
I think I can remember "911" by myself, thanks. usually the phone comes
with three emergency buttons, and I can't even think of two other numbers
that I'd need to call in an emergency situation. I guess I could call
the correct time, I always found the time lady's voice kind of soothing,
maybe that would help. And I could also call my friend Lindy, because
she's never home and has an answering machine, so I could leave cool
last words for future generations to treasure. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Memory Dial</SPAN><BR>
I never use memory dial. This is because I am so lazy that I can't even
be bothered to put in the effort to set up effort-conserving devices. Getting
memory dial to work  would involve working out my phone number priorities
in detail, finding the phone instructions, looking up each number in my PDA,
hell, it's too tedious to even finish talking about it. Modern
phones have lifespans so short that, if they were breeding organisms,
they'd have to give birth to hundreds of phonelings just to keep the
species going, so it just doesn't seem worth it. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flash</SPAN><BR>
This is much less exciting than it sounds. Phones could flash in so many
interesting ways that it's a pity they use  the word to mean "hang up then
stop hanging up real  quick-like." I understand this feature is real handy for those with call waiting, but my loathing for call waiting is so great that
I consider that a negative, kind of like pointing  out that a given dog
food can also be used to raise giant infectious death geckos. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lit Buttons</SPAN><BR>
A great feature, so great that it shouldn't be considered a feature, but
rather a basic expectation. Since I have to buy a new phone about every
six months -- I assume this is because about 1983 phone manufacturers
started building phone  wiring out of atom-thin strands of gossamer
moonlight -- I sometimes accidentally get one  without a lit face, and
I am consternated in much the same way that I would be if I bought the
one car that didn't have "Comes with a driver's seat!" in the ad. <B>A</B></P>
