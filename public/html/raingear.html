<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Galoshes</SPAN><BR>
Footwear that keeps water out also keeps it in. That's a simple
fact. So if you're really careful, galoshes can keep your socks
dry. If you're <EM>not</EM> really careful, though, they quickly become
Lipton Cup O' Foot Soup. I am rarely really careful, so I don't
bother with galoshes. My socks may be wet, but at least there's
flow-through. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ponchos</SPAN><BR>
It's the simple things that make life so grand. Things like
sticking your head through a hole. Ponchos are nice that way.
They're also nice because they're generally big enough to
protect any backpacks, purses, pages, PDAs, leathermen, or South
American clinging primates you might be carrying on you. And if
you're as tall as I am they can be used as a Slip 'N' Slide
in the summer months. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Umbrellas</SPAN><BR>
These are so nice and playful and fun and enjoyable that I'm
willing to overlook the fact that they don't work worth driveway
gravel. Unless you come from the Magical Land of Entirely
Vertical Precipitation, your entire lower body is going to get
soaked by any stroll longer than from the car to the coffee shop.
But more effective rain protection rarely comes in the shape of
a happy frog head, so it's a trade-off. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rain Hats</SPAN><BR>
I don't see enough of these. Why aren't people wearing rain hats?
About the only people I ever see in rain hats are kids in Kodak commercials
and Christopher Robin. Maybe I need to live someplace rainier. Or
someplace where people are more casual about putting yellow rubber
things on their heads. Either way. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rain Suit</SPAN><BR>
The really good rain suits are the transparent ones, because
you can put them on and pretend to be ribbed for her pleasure.
Alternatively, if you're wearing a nice suit you can pretend
that you sent your whole body to the dry cleaners and just
got it back. Both of which are more fun than admitting you're
just a wet dork in a plastic sheath. <B>D+</B></P>
