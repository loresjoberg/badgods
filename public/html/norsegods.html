<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thor</SPAN><BR>
Very different from the Fabioesque Marvel superhero, the
original Thor defined macho centuries before muscle cars and 
chaps even existed. We're dealing with a being who owned
magical goats which he slaughtered and ate every night.
The next day they came back to life, he'd have them
pull his divine cart for a while, then he'd <EM>eat 'em
again!</EM> This is an entity who lost only one drinking 
contest is his entire existence, and then only because
as it turned out he was drinking the entire sea and didn't
realize it. Not big on perception skills, but he sure
could hold his liquor and/or seawater. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Loki</SPAN><BR>
Having earned a B.A. in literature from a California
university, I've attended more lectures on The Trickster
Figure in Myth than I care to recall. You've got Coyote,
Eshu, The Great Gazoo, the list goes on and on. And then
you've got Loki. "Trickster figure" doesn't even begin to
cover it. You think trickster, you think practical jokes, 
shoplifting, maybe some tagging. You don't tend to think
of leading the legions of hell in battle against
the gods at the end of the universe, but that's exactly
what Loki's got jotted down in his celestial Palm Pilot.
Also he's fathering illegitimate monsters with a giantess
in his off hours. Heavy. <B>B+</B></P>


<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Balder</SPAN><BR>
The god of love, purity, beauty, blah blah blah. Balder's
mom was worried about him, so she got all objects in the
universe to swear they'd never kill him, which is pretty
obsessive. Unfortunately for some reason she 
overlooked a mistletoe tree, and so Balder suffered the 
godly and heroic death of a mistletoe sprig through the heart.
Then the goddess of death agreed to give him back if everything
in the universe wept for him. Which everyone did except for
Loki. Moral of the story: there's always someone to fuck anything
up. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Freya</SPAN><BR>
This is the one you always forget when you try to remember
who the days are named after. She got Friday named after her,
so somewhere in the universal unconscious she's forever associated
with three-day-weekends. She had sex with four dwarfs in exchange for a 
necklace. She has a lover named Ottar who is disguised as a wild boar.
She once appeared on "Love Connection" and got a date with Hank from
Detroit. Two of the previous three sentences are accurate. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ymir</SPAN><BR>
Dead giant. Ymir is responsible for some of the most unappetizing
aspects of the Norse mythos. To begin with, humanity emerged from
his armpit. This is not a madcap comedy from the makers of "Dumb and Dumber,"
this is actual ancient myth. Later on, after he's dead, the human-habitable
portion of reality is formed from his eyebrow. So if you wonder why
the gods no longer commune with us, there's your explanation. We are
armpit sweat living on a giant dead eyebrow. <B>B</B></P>
