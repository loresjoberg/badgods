<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pocky</SPAN><BR>
These are little cookie-like sticks dipped in chocolate. Very straightforward,
and more addictive than "Ben and Jerry's Crack N' Tobacco Crunch." They
also have Melon Pocky, Coconut Pocky, Giant Pocky, some sort
of crunchy Pocky which I think has toffee or something, and 
"Pocky for Men." I'm not sure if those last ones have testosterone
in them or just look good with a suit and tie, but there's
a certain macho appeal to eating a <EM>man's</EM> chocolate-covered
cookie snack. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Everyburger</SPAN><BR>
Certainly there's no dearth of food shaped like other food in Western
culture -- I had a Jell-O salad shaped like a pig just last week --
but Everyburger deserves big handclaps for attention to detail. The
darned things look unnervingly like hamburgers. The chocolate "meat"
is precisely the correct color, and the cookie "bun" actually has
miniscule "sesame seeds." If Goldfish Crackers had that much devotion to 
verisimilitude, they'd all have little glazed eyes staring helplessly
up at you. And who wouldn't enjoy that? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Seasoned Cuttlefish Crackers</SPAN><BR>
I don't want to ever hear you say I never ate seasoned cuttlefish
crackers for you. They're even shaped like cuttlefish, although
I must admit I haven't spent enough time around cuttlefish to
tell how precise the likeness is. If you've ever eaten shrimp chips,
they taste kind of like those. If you've never eaten shrimp chips,
you're probably not going to want to start at this late
stage of the game. <B>C-</B></P>

More candy. I picked this one up because it had both a triumphant
athlete and a wooden toy duck on the box. Unable to drum up the
faintest connection between the two, I bought it. This is a common
experience with me and Japanese candy. Anyhow, the wooden toy duck
is because the box contains a wooden toy duck, and the triumphant
athlete is because the packaging designer was insane. The box also contains weird
squishy strawberry candy, kind of like gummi candy with no will to live.
There's just no sports connection whatsoever. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Meiji, um, Things</SPAN><BR>
I don't know what these are, except that they're vaguely reminiscent of
Fun-Yuns. Judging from the packaging, I had assumed they would taste like
a happy frog, a hungry little guy with a beard, or a bowl of soup.
Upon prying open the bag, however, I was greeted with the familiar aroma
of curry and relief. These are quite tasty! They're little crunchy curry 
units! I can dig it! <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hello Kitty Lips Candy</SPAN><BR>
They don't taste a damn <EM>thing</EM> like Hello Kitty lips. <B>D</B></P>
