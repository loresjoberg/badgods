<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Here Comes Santa Claus</SPAN><BR>
This is a blatant example of lazy songwriting. I
mean, really, "Santa Claus Lane"? Where, exactly, is Santa Claus Lane?
If your particular town doesn't have a Santa Claus Lane, does that mean
Santa Claus can't come right down it, and children will wake up Christmas
morning to find nothing but empty stockings and apologies? Or is it like
a carpool lane, a special section of the freeway you can't drive unless
you're a jolly old elf or are accompanied by a jolly old elf? Correct
answer: they made it up, it sounds jaunty. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosty the Snowman</SPAN><BR>
You know what I like about this song? It has an
honest-to-Kringle sad ending. Doomed from the start, Frosty ends up
melting like a Crayola on the dashboard, with only the promise that
he'll come back again someday. It's the <CITE>Empire Strikes Back</CITE>
of Christmas carols. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jingle Bell Rock</SPAN><BR>
I don't know where they get off calling this "rock." It's
not even Jingle Bell Easy Listening. Not a great song in the first place,
this is made even worse by its overinflated sense of hipness. I can just
imagine some sixty-five-year-old crooner saying "And here's one the young
people will enjoy." You want to hear a Christmas rock song? The Kinks,
"Father Christmas," end of story. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Chipmunk Song</SPAN><BR>
 The starkly limited appeal that the chipmunks ever held
for me was hearing hits of the Eighties rendered in their electronically
tortured little voices. (Which is not to say that most Eighties pop stars
didn't themselves have electronically tortured voices.) Given that, I fail 
to see why anyone would be interested in their original compositions. How do
you explain Christ to a chipmunk anyway? <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Little Drummer Boy</SPAN><BR>
There's something charming about this, a song about
the world's first drum solo. It also has a nice little lesson about how
you should give whatever you can. Presumably if the drummer boy didn't
have his drum, he would have given the newborn savior a little shadow
puppet show or something. Me, I would have just asked one of the wise
men if I could put my name on his gift too and pay him back later. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">My Favorite Things</SPAN><BR>
When did this become a Christmas song? I remember
hearing this as part of the infuratingly soothing mall lineup a few
Christmases ago, and since then it's been a minor player in the carol
scene. It has a couple references to mittens and packages and the like,
but it's hardly a seasonal song. Can't we all agree that the Christmas
canon doesn't need adding to? If you're really getting tired of the
usual songs -- and who isn't -- learn "Fum Fum Fum" or "The Wassail Song"
or something. <B>C-</B></P>
