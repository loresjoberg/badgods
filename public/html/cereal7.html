I'm not clear on the reason behind the misspelling of "vitamin." It's not whimsical, it's just odd. The same, however, could be said for the cereal, which tastes kind of like low-grade Cap'n Crunch, as if Cap'n Crunch had retired from the Cereal Navy and left operations to Lieutenant Junior Grade Crunch, who decided to reduce overhead by cutting the stuff with Corn Chex. I'd suggest getting this only if you're still dependent on your junkfood-hating parents for your breakfast needs and the "Vitaman" convinces them it's healthy, or if you're really into royalty. <B>D</B></P></TD>

When someone tells you "There's no 'I' in 'team,'" you can now counter with "Yes, but there is an 'I' in 'Team Cheerios.'" It makes no sense, but while they're thinking it over you can throw down your smoke bombs and slink back into the shadows. Aside from that bit of helpfulness, Team Cheerios is not bad if you want a sweet cereal that actually retains some evidence of its agricultural origins.  <B>C+</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pok&eacute;mon Cereal</SPAN><BR>
Licensed cereals, like licensed video games, movies and sex toys, are often thrown together with little or no thought, on the assumption that the name alone will draw the  kids/gamers/theater-goers/deviants in. I'm sure it works, but it leads to lifeless, soulless products like Pok&eacute;mon Cereal, which is nothing more than Lucky Charms with O-shaped cereal bits and superficially different blobby marshmallows. At least I think they're different. For all I know they're going to recycle the Pikachu bits as "Lucky Golden Rat Heads" next month. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

Now this is breakfast cereal innovation! This is pushing the artifically-colored envelope! Powerpuff Girls Cereal is made up of gaily-colored rice polyps laced with <EM>Pop Rocks</EM>! It's weird! It's fun! It's like there's a chiropractor in your mouth! The only flaws are that it's not called something more interesting like Powerpuff Puffs, and that it kind of skimps on actual flavor. But for God's sake, who cares? It's got Pop Rocks! <B>B+</B></P></TD>

Ignoring for a moment the fact that this cereal's name sounds like some sort of tree disease, this isn't bad. I mean, you could always combine a box of Cocoa Puffs with a box of Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch, but you wouldn't. I know you. You keep saying you'll do cool stuff like that and then you're all "Hey, 'Passions' is on" and you totally blow it off. So it's just as well that they pre-combine puffs for my fast-breaking pleasure. <B>B</B></P></TD>
