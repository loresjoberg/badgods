<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Horseshoe</SPAN><BR>
Sure, why not. There's probably some goddess-crescent connection here,
and if there isn't I'm sure there are plenty of liberal arts undergrads
willing to make one up. My favorite part is how you're supposed to
keep your lucky horseshoe's ends up "to keep the luck from pouring out."
Because you don't want to have a doorstep covered in luck which will enter the
sewage system during the next rain and drain to the ocean, resulting in
unnaturally fortunate salmon.  The resulting devastating impact on the
ecosystem is easy to envision. So watch it. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rabbit Foot</SPAN><BR>
Yeah yeah, it wasn't lucky for the rabbit, we've all heard that one
about a million times, and the only reason I even mention it is to 
avoid mail "reminding" me of this "oversight." Even so, I find
rabbit's feet a little gruesome to pin my personal fortunes to.
I don't want to be put in the position of saying "I owe all my success
and acclaim to this dismembered mammal limb I keep with me." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shooting Star</SPAN><BR>
That's right, an isolated chunk of interstellar grit traversed uncounted
miles of cold space, then fell into the sea of our atmosphere and died
in a slashing trail of flame so that you could wish for a new
set of speakers for your Chevy Tahoe. I mean, astrology also assumes
heavenly objects determine whether it's a good time to buy a new shirt,
but at least astrology doesn't require Venus to crash into the earth for
to do so. On the other hand, shooting stars are pretty. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lucky Penny</SPAN><BR>
"FInd a penny, pick it up, and all the day you'll have good luck." Does
this apply to convenience store penny trays? You possess the penny
for an instant before handing it to the clerk, don't you? You found it,
you picked it up. My God, this could revolutionize the science of
random prosperity. It could take its place among other examples of
modern luck-generation innovations like the steam-powered wishing well
and Rainbow Brite. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Four-Leaf Clover</SPAN><BR>
I imagine most good luck charms have an annoying song associated with
them if you look hard enough (e.g. "Lucky Star") but this one is just out
of control. I don't know if it was the traditional Sing Along with Mitch
version or the gory schoolyard parody that made it impossible for me to
consider clover of any variety -- even clover honey -- without hearing
"...that I overlooked beFORE!" echoing insanely through my head, but I
don't like it. <B>C-</B></P>
