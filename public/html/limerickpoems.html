<h2>Famous Poems Rewritten as Limericks</h2>
<h3>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening</h3>

<p class="main_text">
There once was a horse-riding chap<br />
Who took a trip in a cold snap<br />
He stopped in the snow<br />
But he soon had to go:<br />
He was miles away from a nap.
</p>

<h3>The Raven</h3>

<p class="main_text">
There once was a girl named Lenore<br />
And a bird and a bust and a door<br />
And a guy with depression<br />
And a whole lot of questions<br />
And the bird always says "Nevermore."
</p>

<h3>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</h3>

<p class="main_text">
There was an old father of Dylan<br />
Who was seriously, mortally illin'<br />
"I want," Dylan said<br />
"You to bitch till you're dead.<br />
"I'll be cheesed if you kick it while chillin'."
</p>

<h3>I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud</h3>

<p class="main_text">
There once was a poet named Will<br />
Who tramped his way over a hill<br />
And was speechless for hours<br />
Over some stupid flowers<br />
This was years before TV, but still.
</p>

<h3>Footprints in the Sand</h3>
<p class="main_text">
There was a man who, at low tide<br />
Would walk with the Lord by his side<br />
Jesus said "Now look back;<br />
You'll see one set of tracks.<br />
That's when you got a piggy-back ride."
