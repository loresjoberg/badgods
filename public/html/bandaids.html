I'm not sure what purpose these are intended to serve. Do people get 
in a lot of hole-punch accidents? Wouldn't a standard rectangular
Band-Aid adhere better? My theory here is that as a result of 
playing with peg-and-hole toys between story time and snack time as toddlers,
we as a culture now have a primal need to match up shapes, even in
minor medical emergencies. If there were any reasonable way to get a
flesh wound in the shape of a rhombus, we'd probably have rhomboid
bandages in the variety pack as well. <B>C</B></P>

Nice to see the folks in R&amp;D earning their stock options, but I remain
unimpressed. I'm a tolerant man when it comes to first aid, but I think we've
coddled our paper cuts for too long. There's only one proven way to get a
Band-Aid to stay on your finger, and that's to wrap it so tightly that
your fingertip turns the color of cranberry juice cocktail, thereby
shifting your worries from infection to amputation. All the
intricately-shaped specialty bandages in the world won't change that.

If your cut, burn, abrasion or pimple scab is to small that you
can cover it up with one of these, you can probably safely ignore it.
And if you're going for the sympathy ploy, which I suspect is where
a hefty portion of the world Band-Aid flow goes, you may as well
go for one of the big ones and score the maximum amount of concerned 
looks you can get without breaking out the gauze.<B>B-</B></P>

These are everything do-it-yourself medical treatment should be. They're
sterile, easy to use, and they make loss of bodily fluids fun! Although
in all fairness, I should say sterile <EM>or</EM> easy to use, but
not both. I've never been able to get the hang of attaching the
thing to my body using only the easy-peel backing; I either end up
missing the laceration in question by a centimeter or so, or
dropping the damn thing on the floor. I doubt that touching the
sticky bit is going to end up inducing gangrene, but it's the
principle of the thing. Band-Aids are as close as I'm likely to get to 
performing elective surgery, and I want to do it right. <B>A-</B></P>

While I understand the principles behind these ("Anything children
touch must have merchandised cartoons on it"), I'm concerned about
the psychological impact. Do we really want pain and blood loss
associated with My Little Pony in children's minds? Do we really
want to hand disaffected Lit majors yet another vivid metaphor
with which to describe their disaffected childhoods? ("I looked down
and saw Bert and Ernie covering my wound, just as
so-called 'happiness' and 'togetherness' concealed the oozing
pus of hypocrisy that I called my family.") It's just a little odd.
