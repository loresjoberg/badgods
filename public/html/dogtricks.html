<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stay</SPAN><BR>
Handy if it works. I've heard tell that there are dogs
that have been taught to stay even if there's raw meat
six feet in front of them. That's got to go against every
strand in dog DNA. I'd have imagined that even if you
could get the dog's body to stay put, its brain would leap out
of its skull, bounce across the lawn, and start gnawing on the
steak with its medulla. It just goes to show the power of a
charismatic primate. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fetch</SPAN><BR>
"Fetch" obviously enough, isn't the trick. The trick is
"Having fetched, bring the object back and actually let
me have it, rather than turning this into a rousing game of
'hand vs. jaw.'" The really cool fetchers are the frisbee fetchers,
the ones that throw themselves up into the air with wild abandon
and look like they should be in an
ad for some translucent-green citrus sports drink or another.
It's a great sport, and yet it's the only one that hasn't been
featured on ESPN2 yet. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Play Dead</SPAN><BR>
Isn't this kind of morbid? Outside of heart-wrenching
family films, what is the appeal here? Do
the people who train their dogs to play dead also teach
them tricks like "fake a bad case of roundworms"? Or is
this just the trick that comes free with every dog, given that
"play dead" is basically equivalent to "lie on the ground and
ignore all non-food stimuli"? <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sit</SPAN><BR>
I've known many dogs who are trained to sit given only the subtle 
physical signal of grabbing their hindquarters and shoving
them downward forcefully. The signal for "lie down" takes two people,
and the signal for "heel" involves waiting patiently for your dog
to get bored with whatever it's chasing, sniffing, and/or marking.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Come</SPAN><BR>
This, like many tricks, is based on the dog's intrinsic faith that
food may suddenly become available at any time, so you have to follow
up all your leads. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that the sorts of
dogs who trot around the circle at British dog shows do this
and other tricks out of fierce loyalty to the Alpha Mammal, but
your average neighborhood-roaming sloppy dog is working on the
knowledge that humans produce food at unpredictable intervals. 
But hey, whatever works. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Speak</SPAN><BR>
This can be kind of fun, although it goes along with "Beg" into
the class of "Tricks it Would Be More Impressive to Teach Your
Dog <EM>Not</EM> to Do." I've lived next to dogs that had gone way
past "speak" into "filibuster." <B>C-</B></P>
