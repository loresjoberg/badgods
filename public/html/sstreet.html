<P><BIG><B>Cookie Monster</B></BIG><BR>
Cookie is the MAN! Cookie's got it ALL going on! Cookie is 
a huge terry-cloth  mass of greed, gluttony, and astonishing lack of self-restraint, and this is on EDUCATIONAL TV! And Cookie Monster, in his 
Zen-like wisdom, provided my generation with perhaps the only clear moral 
message we'll ever know, a beacon for our scattered lives: "C is for cookie, 
and that's good enough for me." It's good enough for all of us, 
Cookie. <B>A</B></P>  

<P><BIG><B>Elmo</B></BIG><BR>
I know lots of people are enamored of this Muppet-come-lately, and I 
have to admit I have no idea why. Elmo is this completely harmless, 
sweet, friendly toddler-monster, and he bores the hell out of me. He lacks 
the joie de vivre of his predecessors; you'd never see Elmo tearing apart 
huge Styrofoam vowels, yelling angrily at passerby, or even "doing the 
pigeon." Instead of bizarre antisocial behavior and physical comedy, we 
get cute childlike antics and "tickling." Pleh. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Oscar the Grouch</B></BIG><BR>
Mean people may suck, but Oscar rocks. I always enjoyed Oscar's bit 
where he's happy when he's angry and angry when he's happy, but I never knew I'd be emulating him someday. Oscar is another 
example of a character that wouldn't even be considered if Sesame Street 
were being created today. Instead they'd slip some Zoloft in his feed, 
transplant him to a brightly-colored recycled oil-drum, and have him lead 
"Ring Around the Rosie." <B>A-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Ernie and Bert</B></BIG><BR>
Yeah, yeah. Were they just roommates or were they lovers? 
Listen folks, they  were Muppets. They may have had hands up their asses 
but it was purely for puppeteering purposes. Besides, for my money the 
real sexual tension was between Grover and Kermit. Anyhow, Ernie and Bert 
always had the song-and-dance thing down pat. Ernie's Rubber Ducky song is 
the Sesame Street classic, and Bert's "Doing the Pigeon" had similar 
appeal, plus a really unnerving dance move. And then there was the bit 
where their noses got pulled off. Always fun. <B>B</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>The Count</B></BIG><BR>
Man, talk about a twisted personality! Talk about obsessive-compulsive disorder!  Talk about the numbers one through twelve! You 
really couldn't get the Count into any long-term plots because he really 
only did one thing, but he certainly did it well. I think many children 
learned to count purely on the off chance that they could summon thunder 
and lightning by doing so. But I have one  question. The Count looked like 
a vampire, right down to the fangs. And he had the bat thing going. Was he 
a vampire? Did he feed on living blood? Or, more likely given his 
Muppetness, living felt? A horrifying yet oddly appealing idea. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Big Bird</B></BIG><BR>
The name was kind of a gimme. Big Bird is somewhat less twisted 
than most of the Muppets around him, but due to his intimidating size and 
lack of baby-lisp, he doesn't have the repulsive Elmo cuteness. In the 
early days he had a kind of lovable loser image going, with all his 
hallucination, and his calling Mr. Hooper "Mr. Looper," but Hooper/Looper 
took the dirt nap and Snuffy showed himself to everyone, so B.B.'s in a much 
more capable place now. <B>C+</B></P>
