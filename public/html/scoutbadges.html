Before I get started here, I should point out that I've never been in
the BSA. I was ostensibly in the Cub Scouts as a kid, but my activites
therein wouldn't qualify for any merit badges unless they had badges for
"Watching Cartoons" and "Playing Freeze Tag." So anyway, I think the main
thing I missed out on was the whittling. You're supposed to have a knife,
and you're supposed to be able to make little racing cars and impromptu
rabbit traps and rustic place settings with it. My only major knife
experience was with an X-Acto knife, and it required stitches, so I'm
probably better off despite my disappointment. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">American Labor</SPAN><BR>
This is just odd. I mean, there's nothing wrong with American
Labor per se, but you rarely end up using the words "AFL-CIO"
and "Campfire Jamboree" in the same sentence. 
My feeling is that in order to preserve political balance, there should be
a badge in "Union Busting" as well. ("For this badge, scouts must
put on a suit with a diamond tie-tack, light an expensive cigar, and
say 'Those poor sots don't know how good they got it. Lock the gates.'")

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bugling</SPAN><BR>
I had no idea there was a badge for bugling, but it makes perfect
sense, in spite of the fact that it sounds like a British term for an
uncomfortable sex act. One part of getting this badge is learning all the
bugle calls, including the one for swimming. I don't know why there's
a bugle call for swimming and not for other common camp activites
like furtive masturbation, but I guess that's why I don't get to write
the bugle book. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Space Exploration</SPAN><BR>
Talk about pipe dreams. At least a young scout can hold a reasonable
hope of carving a wooden duck, playing "Taps," or participating in
an auto workers' strike, but the chances of actually putting this
knowledge to work are pretty slim, unless you count pointing out
inconsistencies in "Apollo 13." On the other hand, if my choices are
between building a model rocket for this badge, or comparing double-knit
fabric to industrial-grade woven fabric for the "Textiles" badge,
I'm all over that plastic nose cone action. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Collections</SPAN><BR>
This is a real gimmee. The requirements basically come down to 
"Collect something. Talk about it." Most kids -- and most adults,
for that matter -- have collections of stuff just by virtue of 
not tossing it. I, for instance, have a collection of 286 motherboards,
and somewhere in my parents' garage I have a collection of 
He-Man action figures with missing limbs. Stick those mothers in a plexiglass case
and it's merit badge city. <B>D</B></P>
