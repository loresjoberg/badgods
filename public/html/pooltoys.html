Sunglass ads notwithstanding, these don't actually strike
me as a feasible mode of relaxation. Aside from the fact that
shifting your weight suddenly means a dunk, aside from the 
"invitation to melanoma" factor, aside from the chlorine fumes,
it's hard to feel truly mellow when your head bangs against
a concrete pool rim every few minutes. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Water Wings</SPAN><BR>
Although they look goofy on anyone over the age of five,
these inflatable armpit training wheels are at least more
humane than the other traditional method of learning to swim,
the "uncle throws you into the deep end" school of aquatic
instruction. They don't look like an incredibly reliable
device -- I wouldn't want them handed to me when the whale-watching
tour boat I'm on is capsized by a shy humpback -- but hey, whatever
it takes to give a kid a little confidence. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Water Polo Equipment</SPAN><BR>
Ball games are odd. People seem obsessed with trying
to combine ball games with every mode of transportation:
horseback riding, ice skating, and I once saw a game
where people run cars into a huge Earthball. At any
rate, I'm not entirely sure what being wet adds to the 
sport, aside from making a great Mountain Dew
commercial. My invention to make it more interesting, at
least for the spectators: Marco Water Polo, where everyone
has to keep their eyes closed. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Diving Sticks</SPAN><BR>
These I've only seen in catalogs. They're brightly colored sticks,
and apparently the idea is that you throw them in the water, they
sink, and then go you get them. Sounds pretty tedious, unless
you aspire to be a golder retriever. I've always
found pocket change to be both more of a challenge and more of
a motivator. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Floaty Horsey Rings</SPAN><BR>
I can't remember the last time I saw a real floaty
horsey ring, but I'm willing to endorse them on principle. I have
a soft spot for things that I see more often in cartoons than
in real life: floaty horsey things, boxer shorts with hearts
on them, anvils, round black bombs with sparky fuses, polite
gophers, that sort of thing. So if I did actually run into
a floaty horsey ring, I'm sure I'd enjoy it. <B>A</B></P>
