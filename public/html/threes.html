Suzanne Somers just won't go away, will she? But before the Buttmaster,
before the Thighmaster, before the Suzanne Somers Show and She's the Sheriff
there was Christmas "Chrissy" Snow, capturing the hearts and "minds"
of the sort of people who found Marilyn Monroe movies too intellectual. 
Without her, the show would have been nothing more than a genteel sitting-room 
comedy of the type so loved by the Edwardian British, and indeed her departure
signaled the beginning of the end for this lovable space that needs your
face. And hey, how many women can claim to have single-handedly set the 
feminist movement back 20 years? <B>D+</B></P>

Where Chrissy taught us that you can be a bimbo and still rake in the bucks
hawking dubious athletic equipment on infomercials, Janet provided the good
news that just because you're dark-haired and assertive doesn't mean you
can't be treated like bargain-counter meat as well. In fact, one of the central
messages of Three's Company is that <EM>everyone</EM> can get leered 
at in public.  Except, perhaps, for Mister Furley. But we'll get to
him in a bit. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Larry</SPAN><BR>
Wisecracking Mercutio to Jack's Romeo, philosophical Horatio to Jack's madcap
Hamlet, Larry was an every-jerk who served the incredibly important
purpose of making all the other spongebrains on the roster look good by
comparison. I mean, let's face it, nobody on "Three's Company" is exactly a 
supernova of taste and charisma. By and large they make the Sweathogs look 
like the cultural elite. Next to Larry, though, they blossom into borderline
non-loserhood. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jack</SPAN><BR>
Am I the only one who noticed that "Jack Tripper" is a sort of
anagrammy acrostic thingie for "Jack T[he] Ripper"? One more
subliminal gambit in the International Sitcom Conspiracy, but it
gave the whole show a disturbing air, as if the season finale might
involve a crawlspace and the phrase "Hunter of the Lord." Anyhow.
Jack, I think, provided the only legitimate cultural truth in the
series. To wit: if you can cook really well, you can get away with
anything. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mr. Furley</SPAN><BR>
This must have been quite a stretch for Don Knotts, having to break out
of his usual role of lemur-eyed backwater twit on the edge on an
aneurysm to play a suburban, bandana-wearing lemur-eyed twit on the
edge of an aneurysm. I imagine there's probably a whole cohort of 
Roper partisans out there who see Furley as a landlord-come-lately,
sort of a George Lazenby of bedroom farce, but Knotts is the
one with the range. He's played a cartoon fish, for God's sake! A lemur-eyed
cartoon fish on the edge of an aneurysm, to be fair, but still, I'd like
to see Norman Fell try <EM>that</EM> one. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Ropers</SPAN><BR>
Who in the name of the Roman God of Spin-offs thought that anyone
wanted to see a half-hour dedicated to these people? On the
show they were passable second bananas, keeping comedic tensions high
by threatening to toss Jack out on this corduroy-encased ass if he
showed any signs of heterosexuality, but whatever meager laughs they
contributed were due solely to their sheer awfulness. Take a completely
repulsive couple, the male of which is constantly fending off sexual
advances of the female, put them in their own show, and what do you
get? Well, "Married With Children," actually. All the more reason
to abhor them. <B>D</B></P>
