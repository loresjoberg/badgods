<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sundials</SPAN><BR>
In spite of the fact that ancient Romans probably 
would have swapped any number of valuable art relics 
for  a single Sailor Moon digital watch, people still 
love to put sundials on their lawns and in their 
gardens. This reverence for the obsolete is oddly 
selective -- nobody seems to want to bring back 
smallpox for that retro forties effect, but clocks made 
out of concrete are big business. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flamingos</SPAN><BR>
The disturbing thing is not that they're plastic. The 
disturbing thing is not that they're pink. The 
disturbing thing is that they only have one leg. 
People across the Midwest are decorating their lawns 
with deformed mutant bottom feeding birds. What 
pleasure they extract from peering out at their twisted 
mockeries of avian life I can't fathom. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Windmill Flowers</SPAN><BR>
This is what I love about middle American home 
decor: they just can't leave well enough alone. It's not 
too tough to grow some nice flowers, but no matter 
what you plant--peonies to orchids--they won't spin in 
merry circles when the wind blows. But plastic, as 
usual, comes to the rescue. Stick some windmill 
flowers in the soil and they'll spin to beat the band, 
assuming your band needs beating. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Topiary</SPAN><BR>
A charming decoration combining the soothing urban-
pastoral effect of hedges with the disturbing eerieness 
of mounted deer heads. There's nothing that says "I 
have a giant scrubby rabbit on my lawn" like a giant 
scrubby rabbit on your lawn. My thought is that the 
ultimate sporting spectacle would be if we could 
somehow get a topiary rabbit and an ice sculpture 
swan to battle to the death. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gnomes</SPAN><BR>
Hey, who doesn't want short people in funny hats on 
their lawn? Heck, that's the only reason people throw 
kids' birthday parties. And you don't even have to buy 
lawn gnomes high-powered water rifles, although the 
idea is not without its appeal. Where flamingos are 
merely tacky, lawn gnomes are actively weird. <B>A-</B></P>
