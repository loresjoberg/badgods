<p class="ratingheader">Impossible</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Good way to make your extreme sport seem more exciting: give your tricks
names that make them sound unreasonably difficult.  This applies to
other activities, too. If you're a carpenter, don't just make a credenza,
make a "paradox credenza". Want to impress a potential life-mate on that
all-important morning after?  Don't just make a pesto scramble, make a
"pesto scramble that defies the laws of space and time." If you're going to
make a movie, why make a documentary about independent fishermen when you could make a "documentary about independent fishermen that people actually
want to watch"? <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Melon</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Kinda dull. "I did a melon" sounds like a scene from a teenage sex comedy,
not a potentially life-bruising trick pulled off at dozens of miles an
hour. But in the end, it's a well-chosen name because the move is hard,
but sweet. Naw, I just made that up. For all I know it was invented by
Douglas Reginald Melon. Or it was called the "delectable firm female
breast move" and Neversoft cleaned it up for the kiddies. So many possibilities,
it makes my head spin, flip the board, then shoot up the half-pipe. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Nose Manual</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This has something to do with balancing on two wheels, but it's better
out of context. Frankly, I think we could all use a nose manual. As an
exercise in whimsy, I am adapting the StarTrak Astronomy Program User
Manual to our nose-based purposes. Chapter One: What is your nose?
What does it do? Chapter Two: Setting up your nose for your timezone.
Chapter Three: Selecting an object in your nose. <span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Kickflip McTwist</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad skateboarding grabbed this one, because I think it's important
that <em>something</em> be called "Kickflip McTwist."  If it didn't
show up in the game, we'd either have to invent a new ice-cream-based
fast food beverage, pitch a cop show to Fox or, as a last resort, dig
up Dr. Seuss's corpse and make him write one last story about a little
boy with an unusual way of walking. Presumably a Grooba-ma-foo would be
involved at some point. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">360</p>
<p class="ratingbody">With all these imaginative names for jumping in the air and spazzing
out, it's kind of disappointment that rotations are treated strictly
mathematically. Here's my proposal: a full spin is called a "Raoul."
A half-spin is called a "Buttcracker." A single Raoul is just a Raoul,
but for the second and further full spins, you attach the appropriate
anniversary descriptor: cotton, leather, fruit, and so forth. So if you
manage to pull off four and a half spins, that's a "Candy Raoul
Buttcracker." Tell me that's not satisfying. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>
