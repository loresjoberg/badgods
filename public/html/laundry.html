<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Detergent Vending Machines</SPAN><BR>
In these days of buttons and beeps it's refreshing to
find one of the old soap box vending machines that
works via levers and gravity. I can imagine early Hittite vending
machines built on the same principles, forty slaves employed to shift the
lever to "Biz," and another forty to pull the knob. Many would
be crushed by the huge cardboard box that came crashing down,
but their sacrifice to their despotic god-ruler would not
be forgotten, and in the next life they would be elevated to
the status of "New Improved Slave with April-Fresh Garments." <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fabric Softener</SPAN><BR>
Call me calloused, but I've never suffered from hard clothes.
As long as the mustard stains come out, I'm not usually concerned
about such niceties as making sure that my towels are soft enough to
adequately cushion the impact of falling teddy bears. Speaking of
which, tell me the Snuggle bear isn't eerie. It encapsulates everything
that's wrong with puppetry today. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dryer Lint</SPAN><BR>
You know, if someone volunteered to be the George Washington Carver
of dryer lint, I bet we could find enough ecologically sound uses
for the stuff to make hemp look like Styrofoam hamburger boxes by comparison.
Lint will save the planet! I fully expect next year's globally-conscious
hipsters to be sporting their 100% organic lint jackets and baseball
caps.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Carts</SPAN><BR>
Is there such thing as a laundry cart in good condition, or
do they come straight out the factory with a bent hanger bar and a stuck wheel?
These were a lot more fun when I was a kid and my brother and I would play
Laundry Cart Drag Racing, switching off between being
the pilot/helpless-victim-of-dryer-collisions and the cart-pusher/Mom-lookout.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Posters</SPAN><BR>
There's this one series of laundromat posters that look like they were 
created circa 1963 by the same creative minds that brought you
get well cards about nurse bosoms. The most memorable of these has
a freaky-looking cartoon mortician saying "Don't Dye Here." Pretty weird,
but considering that most laundromat hours I've logged to date have 
been spent fighting off choking boredom, a little visual diversion
is welcome, no matter how unsettling. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bulletin Boards</SPAN><BR>
I don't know who decided that laundromats are the social and economic centers
of the modern world, but at least these provide a bit of entertainment.
I mean, if you've seen one Strat for sale you've seen them all, and if
I wanted my house cleaned, my back massaged, or my income invested
in multi-level marketing schemes, I probably wouldn't go to the bulletin
boards at the 'mat, but it's always interesting to see what
kind of requirements people have for roommates, ("Must not eat meat,
worship graven images, laugh at Yo-Yo Ma's name.") and what local
cultural activities are coming up ("Master of the Latvian Armpit Banjo!").
