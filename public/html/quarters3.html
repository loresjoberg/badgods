Okay, they've got the Statue of Liberty, that's a gimme. They
also have a picture of the state itself, which is something of
a motif among uncreative quarter designers. At least New York has
an excuse, though: they need something to convince Buffalo and
Syracuse that they're important, too. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

North Carolina's coin has a lovely picture of the Wright Brothers
catching some air. Take that, Ohio! Actually, thanks to the magic
of bas relief, it looks like Wilbur is going to have his tiny head
chopped right off, so if you like to make up gruesome stories at bus stops
and need inspiration, this coin may be right up your alley. <B>C+</B></P></TD>

There's a nice picture of the Pell Bridge, which let's be honest looks
like pretty much any other suspension bridge, at least when reduced
to pocket change, and a nice sailboat.  The mint's blurb explains that
Rhode Island's most popular sport is sailing, and I believe that they
are lying to me. I figure that sailing is a pretty expensive thing to
get into, and I'm betting there are more games of dodge ball, foosball
or possibly punch bug going on in Rhode Island than there are sailing
events at any given time. It's just a feeling I have. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

Hey, it's got a chilly-looking guy collecting maple syrup! There's also
some famous-only-to-natives mountain in back, but who cares. If they
can't, for legal reasons, put a pint of Chunky Monkey on the quarter,
some guy sucking the sap out of trees for my breakfast pleasure is
a good second choice. <B>B+</B></P></TD>

The Kentucky quarter has an old Kentucky home and the words "My Old
Kentucky Home" inscribed on it. Not just any old Kentucky home, but
the very same old Kentucky home which inspired the song "My Old Kentucky Home."
I mention all this only in an attempt to make "Kentucky" not look like
a word anymore. It also has a racehorse. Well, I assume it's a racehorse.
It could just be a plain old regular horse with good bone structure and
a strict fitness regimen. <B>C</B></P></TD>
