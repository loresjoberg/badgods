Everything's better on a stick. Everything! The only foodstuffs that aren't
improved by impalement are those that thanks to a 
cruel twist of surface tension <EM>can't</EM> be put on a stick, like
barbecue sauce and Irish cream. Sure, with
Eskimo Pies and their ilk the chocolate shell comes off at the slightest
provocation, but that's part of the fun! It's on a stick!  <B>A+</B></P>

By this I mean the rectangular type with nondescript chocolate "bread" on
either side. These are fun, even though the chocolate material clings to
your fingers with a ferocity rarely seen outside of the orange crap on
Chee-Tos. The major selling point is in the Neapolitan version though,
where you can learn a lot about yourself from whether you eat the
strawberry, chocolate or vanilla third first, or eat all three at once
in some misguided attempt at egalitarian chorfing. I don't know exactly
what you learn, but I'm sure it's significant. <B>B</B></P>

A completely different wad of dairy than rectangular ice cream
sandwiches, these are such a great idea that I find it difficult to
believe the Romans conquered the better part of Europe without them.
Ice cream. Cookies. Sometimes chocolate. I'm tempted to run a stick
through them just so that I can know true novelty nirvana. <B>A</B></P>

You know, there are always people who have a damp and subdued sense
of fun. These are the people who sit on the stationary horses on the
carousel. The people who consider pear halves to be dessert.  The people
who always eat pizza with a fork and knife.  These are also the people
who, when given a choice from the ice cream novelties bin at the local
nacho-dispensing convenience chain store, pick the little bitty tubs of
ice cream with strawberry stripes and a flat wooden spoon. 
I don't get them. <B>D-</B></P>

I am of course talking about the preassembled cones here. In particular,
the ones where the ice cream continues the cone shape even beyond the
actual cone. I like those. I mean, the cone is generally stale and almost
chewy, the ice cream second rate, they're often called "Drumsticks"
which isn't appetizing for a dessert no matter how you interpret it,
and half the peanuts fall off and cower in the bag, but they've got a
certain marginally symmetrical charm. <B>C+</B></P>
