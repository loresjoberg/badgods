<P><BIG><B>Twinkies</B></BIG><BR> The quintessential Hostess 
food, similar to foods you might create in your own kitchen, 
but profoundly different. Yes, the outer coating bears a 
passing resemblance to sponge cake, and the "creamy 
filling" might have once read a book about a dairy product, 
but overall it has that quality of taste and texture that can only 
be found on the snack food aisle. <B>A+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Cupcakes</B></BIG><BR> These are odd. What is it with 
the so-called frosting? It's this weird flat tortilla of sugar and 
chocolate clinging pathetically to the much larger cake unit. 
The best theory I've heard is that the cake and frosting of a 
Hostess cupcake are actually the male and female versions of 
the same organism. This would mean that the little swirl of 
white frosting on top is actually genetic material, which let's 
face it is what it resembles in the first place.

<P><BIG><B>Chocodiles</B></BIG><BR> A rebel Twinkie. The 
Chocodile rejects the hypocritical sociability of the other 
Twinkies in their happy little packs of three, wrapped in 
plastic and denial, and instead chooses to go it alone, sitting 
in its chocolatey leather jacket and brooding about the futility 
of existence. But they're hard to find and really not as tasty, 
so they get a <B>B.</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Fruit Pies</B></BIG><BR> Hostess is the reigning 
monarch of hand-held pies. You can keep your Dolly 
Madison, your Home Run pies, your miniature pecan pie 
gas station desserts: give me a cherry Hostess fruit pie and a 
place to eat it and I shall gain some weight. Other 
manufacturers skimp on the fruit filling, the shortening for 
the crust, the festive artificial coloring, but not Hostess. 
Truly the luxury model. <B>A</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Suzy Q</B></BIG><BR> What is the point? Do we really 
need a Hostess product where you can see the "creamy 
filling" before you even open the package? The end result is 
that a thick layer of the dessert in question remains attached 
to the wrapper, not to mention the fact that the filling is free 
to squeege out all over your fingers if you're not careful. 
Not the sort of snack food I want my children exposed to.

<P>Unfortunately I have reached an impasse on perhaps the 
most controversial issue of our time. To wit: which are better, 
<B>Ding-Dongs</B> or <B>Ho-Hos</B>?
Blood is shed daily on the streets of some of 
our more pathetic cities over this very question, and I have a 
friend who has promised to personally whack me with a 
titanium microphone stand if I come out on the wrong side, 
although I've forgotten which she prefers. Well, what the 
hell, let's say serve Ho-Hos with red meat and Ding-Dongs 
with fish and give them both an <B>A.</B> </P>
