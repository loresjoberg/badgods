These cards depict members of four rock bands: Queen, Kiss, the Village
People, and The Babys. One of these things is not like the others. I have
no idea who The Babys were, but I'm quite certain the most important
thing that ever happened to them was being grouped with Queen, Kiss,
and the Village People in a bubble gum package. The actual cards are
pretty much what you'd expect: blurry photos of bare chests and ludicrous
outfits. The backs of the cards are either pieces of bigger blurry hairy
chests, or fun facts about the band. For example: "Today, Village People
are the hottest and kinkiest sound in disco." That's pretty hot and kinky. 
Much hotter and kinkier than the hottest and kinkiest sound in diet cola
jingles.  <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

The sitcom that jump-started the careers of Pam Dawber and that other guy,
Mork and Mindy not only made millions laugh their rainbow suspenders off,
it also inspired a heavily classy set of trading cards. First off,
you get ten cards AND a sticker. Secondly, the photos on the cards
don't just sit there and smirk at you. Each and every one has an authentic
Mork and Mindy speech balloon on it, gently corralling such wads of humor
as "GREETINGS, MY MAIN MUNCHKIN!" and "MORK--THAT'S NOT AN ELEVATOR...IT'S
A WASHING MACHINE!" Most of the jokes end with an exclamation point,
because that's how you know they're funny. About half the cards have
another quote on the back, a veritable Morkucopia of hilarity that will
have you laughing and laughing and laughing until you shove the
cards in your mouth and suffocate and die. <span class="ratinggrade">B+</span></p>

The back of this packet has an ad for <cite>The Official Rocky Horror
Picture Show Novel</cite>, the "official" apparently letting you know
that the book is an authorized, authentic really really bad idea. Whatever
charms Rocky Horror holds cannot be translated into text. Plus yelling
along with a novel makes you look really dumb. Moreso. Getting to the
actual contents, the cards are
pretty much what you'd expect: stills from the movie and the odd publicity
shot. The backs are a real disappointment, offering nothing more than
a terse description of the front: "WEDDING CAR," for instance. Oh, and there's
no gum. It completely fails to capture the magic of film, music, or
dressing up in women's clothing. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

I'm not sure what a "convoy code" is. I assume it's some intersection of
chivalry and chewing tobacco. At any rate, the stickers included in
this pack are literal depictions of CB lingo. For instance, "Peanut Butter
Ears" shows a guy, drawn in sort of a crappy Cracked Magazine/Wacky
Packages style, liberally spreading peanut butter into his ears. The
backs of the stickers have portions of a "CB Dictionary," but not the
portion that actually explains the term on the front. So I have no
idea whether a "steamer" really is, as depicted, a car with steam
coming out of the radiator, or if that's a whimsical play on
words. And yet I manage to get by in the world. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

"PHOTO CARDS BY JOHN DEREK," the package excitedly explains, as if anyone
who would buy a packet of Bo Derek pictures gives an airborne coitus who
took them. The selling point is nipples. The photos could be
taken by the ressurected corpse of Alfred Stieglitz and still the only two
concerns of the buyer would be "How many nipples are poking out?" and
"How far out do they poke?" The answers in this case are "Two" and "Not very."
I could have masturbated to them when I was thirteen, but at thirteen
I could have, with a little work, masturbated to "O Canada." And I'm not even Canadian. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>
