<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mini Candy Bars</SPAN><BR>
The reigning czar of empty calories, "fun-size" (apparently fun is
about an inch square) candy
bars are highly processed, excitingly packaged, and about the
only way to get halfway decent chocolate (as opposed to, say,
Tootsie Rolls) in your Halloween pillowcase. I completely dig on
these, even the crappy little Mr. Goodbars, and even today when
I give into tradition and hand out goods to urchins instead of going
and catching a movie, these are the treats I buy, mostly for the
leftover value. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bit O' Honey</SPAN><BR>
What is this? Is this candy? As I remember, each year I gave 
these the old elementary school try, only to be
convinced anew that they were the product of the twisted
mind of a mad confectioner. "I've done it!" I can see him
screaming to the empty walls. "I've combined the
unsettlingly wholesome flavor of honey with the inedibility
of old bus-seat gum! And they called me seriously unbalanced
and in need of a competent therapist! <EM>Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!</EM>"
Bleah. <B>D</B></P>

Mmmm. Time-release sugar. High on sucrose and vibrating at 450 Kilohertz,
suckers were a great way to keep the party rotating. And such festive
colors! Such intense flavors! It was like freebasing Kool-Aid. Even
today I occasionally get a jones for artificial grape flavor that would 
not be believed. It puts one
in the mind of a Saturday morning cartoon version of "Trainspotting."

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bubble Gum</SPAN><BR>
Each year, perhaps the surest sign that the hedonistic sugar frenzy was
coming to an end was when I gave up and started chewing the
gum. The candy bars were a distant memory, the suckers had
been reduced to damp sticks, and even the Smarties had
been poured down my throat like so many Smurf vertebrae, 
and I set to the task of chewing the piles of organ-pink
Double Bubble and Bazooka Joe, more out of a sense of duty
than actual desire. Such are the trials of childhood. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Toothbrushes</SPAN><BR>
Oh, hardy har har. One wag on the block always figured Halloween 
for a good time to spread an important message about dental hygiene.
Like we didn't have toothbrushes at home. Granted, a shiny new
toothbrush <EM>is</EM> kind of nifty, but it's the principle of the
thing, dammit. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jujyfruits</SPAN><BR>
These are basically little cavity factories. They enter your mouth,
they latch onto your teeth and they do <em>not let go.</em> I think
I still have Jujyfruit attached to my back molars from the last
time I ate them, which I believe was the 1989 Spike and Mike
animation festival. They were out of red vines. In addition, they
insist on adding licorice and mint to the otherwise palatable
selection. And finally, they're shaped like, what? Corn? Asparagus?
Eggplant? Spleens? <B>C</B></P>
