<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gaia</SPAN><BR>
Ah, yes, Gaia, the warm, loving earth mother who made a <EM>sickle</EM>
so one of her <EM>sons</EM> could <EM>castrate another</EM> one of
her sons, who also happened to be <EM>his brother</EM> and <EM>her
husband.</EM> This, along with the fact that most of Gaia's offspring
were monsters, hundred-handed giants and the like, makes hers a story
more likely to go over well at a David Lynch film festival than a
solstice retreat/drum circle. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Zeus</SPAN><BR>
Zeus became the head god by dint of not being eaten by his father.
Consider that a sort of eighth habit of highly effective people:
very few of those in positions of power and authority were devoured
at birth. Zeus released his previously-swallowed siblings and defeated his,
became ruler of the sky and land, and in turn 
devoured his first wife Metis for fear of being overthrown by 
his own children. A lot of this goes on in Greek mythology; it's like
those Looney Tunes in which Sylvester swallows Tweety Bird and
Tweety goes on to have a long conversation with whomever else Sylvester
had eaten that day. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ares</SPAN><BR>
I was hoping to blow the lid off the perennial representation of
Ares as a bloodthirsty jerk of a god, but a little research shows
that, nope, he's a jerk. And a bloodthirsty one at that. If you want
Ares to get his due, you have to skip over to the Romans, who loved
this guy. They called him Mars and talked about how noble it was
to get the smackdown in his name. But the Greeks, being more interested
in olive oil and hypotenuses than world conquest, wanted little to do with
him. Good for them. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Aphrodite</SPAN><BR>
Aphrodite was the god of love, desire, and if you watch Xena,
peroxide. She arose from the sea after the severed
genitals of Uranus were discarded there. I just want to point out that
I'm not looking for the particularly gruesome bits from Greek mythology.
You can't read two pages through a book of Greek myths without running
into severed genitals, baby-eating, vomit, sex with animals,
liver-extraction, and similar horrors. It's like Bullfinch meets Troma.
Anyhow. Aphrodite had a magical girdle. Good for her. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dionysus</SPAN><BR>
I'm not going to go into how Dionysus was born. Suffice to say
it fits right in with the other godly birth stories and involves
Zeus' thigh. At any rate, Dionysus attracted a cult following of women
who drank a lot and went into periodic fits of utter madness, which
is pretty much what I'm trying to do with this Web page. It's too
late for me to be raised by mountain nymphs as he was, but I do
what I can with what I have. It was the feasts of Dionysus that inspired
the early Greeks to invent theatre, so you could say that in a roundabout
way Dionysus is responsible for the whole folderol surrounding 
"The Phantom Menace." Good for him. <B>A</B>
