<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fuzzy Dice</SPAN><BR>
The real debate is not over fuzzy dice versus no fuzzy dice.
The real debate is over <EM>white</EM> fuzzy dice versus
<EM>pink</EM> fuzzy dice. You see, your average 50's throwback
T-Bird wannabee will go for the plain old regular white fuzzy dice,
crank up the Billy Joel and/or Huey Lewis and go cruising. It
takes the sort of man who's really comfortable with his sexuality
to dare to use display the fuzzy pink dice. This is the same sort
of hell-with-what-others think attitude that inspired young men
to spend hours on their hair, wear tight jeans, and wiggle their
hips in public in the first place. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Air Fresheners</SPAN><BR>
I don't think I need to point out that an enclosed space with
a pine-shaped scent exuder, the air does not become fresh. It
becomes chokingly pine-scented. Which is not to say that lethal
pine levels are not preferable to some of the car smells I've encountered.
 At least the traditional "tree
that smells like pine" has a sort of aethetic logic. Less
comprehensible are the trees that smell like baby powder, and
the Tasmanaian Devils that smell like anything other than
a carnivorous marsupiual. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sunshades</SPAN><BR>
No fewer than two times in my life have I noticed a car, 
empty, sitting in a parking lot with a sunscreen saying in
big red letters "EMERGENCY. PLEASE CONTACT POLICE!" The emergency
in question appeared to be the crisis-level inability of the
car owner to figure out which side of the car faces out. It's not
like most car-oriented emergencies allow you time to fold out
your cardboard Garfield screen anyway. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dash-Mounted Notepad</SPAN><BR>
"Note...to...self. Don't be...such...an...inattentive jerk...while
driving..." WHAM! The alternative is to write on the notepad while
not taking your eyes off the road. That usually results in messages
that appear to read "Pick up whelf in sorghum choot. How tiny froop.
Mork 3:16." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Compasses</SPAN><BR>
Oh, these are a big help. "We're twenty minutes late for the cheese
auction, I have no idea where we are, and we're, umn, heading kind
of westish." That in addition to the fact that most dashboard
compasses look like they're manufactured with all the quality control
of a bootleg Power Ranger. I wouldn't trust one of them to tell
me which way is down if I dropped it, much less lead me on some
sort of urban orienteering spree. <B>D</B></P>
