<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Three is a Magic Number</SPAN><BR>
While it's pleasant to see Schoolhouse Rock delving into
the occult, some of their evidence for the eldrich power of the
number three is pretty sketchy: people reproduce, human anatomy
can be divided into three parts if you ignore almost all major
organs, and tricycles have three wheels. I wasn't aware that 
tricycles figured so prominently in cabalistic lore.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Verb: That's What's Happening</SPAN><BR>
A very nice foray into horn-laced funk, although the vocals
sound kind of like <CITE>Jackson Browne Sings the Hits of
Sly and the Family Stone</CITE>. Extra points for the
chest-hair-exposing superhero, who apparently has the
incredible power to perform actions, and the affirmation at
the end that <EM>love</EM> is what's happening. <B>B+</B></P>

50's doo-wop seems out of place and tired in the Schoolhouse melange
of sixties and seventies pop music styles. Not to mention that the
first couple verses are dedicated to teaching kids the important
but difficult-to-grasp fact that things fall downward. An addition,
I object to the author's plea to keep Mary-Jean in the dark about
basic concepts of physics. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sufferin' Till Suffrage</SPAN><BR>
I'd like to point out that the red-headed 
diva belting this one out pioneered the "bell-bottoms, bare midriff,
and t-shirt with cute little graphic on it" look some twenty-five
years before it became popular. Um, again. She also continues
the superhero theme we see throughout the series, with her incredible
powers to twirl, transform into a powerful voting bloc, and adopt
historical women's fashions. I wonder if she and Verb are dating. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">I'm Just a Bill</SPAN><BR>
This is a catchy and remarkably complete treatment of a complicated
subject, featuring perhaps the most adorable piece of legislation
in history, although I understand the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act was
pretty cute. It helps that the bill in question concerns school-bus
safety. A tax hike or a law proclaiming National Mayonnaise Week
probably wouldn't have been as sympathetic. <B>A+</B></P>
