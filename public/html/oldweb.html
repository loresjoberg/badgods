Back before the Spot, Web-wide world was divided as to whether we
should use these new-fangled "background gif" and "table" features on our
Web pages, or stick with minimal markup, which would allow even blind
people to find out how much we like They Might Be Giants. Along came
The Spot, which proved once and for all that by giving the big finger
to the blind, you could attract sighted geeks by the bargeload. This
was accomplished by having fictional women in bikinis write about
their personal lives in large fonts with orange backgrounds. So you
can see it was an important step in the evolution of the Web. <B>D</B></P>

The entire purpose of this column, actually, is to provide a link
to this seminal (in the literal sense of being full of semen) Web
page. The DFC was devoted to the proposition that The Family
Circus is much funnier if you assume that someone is always having
kinky sex off-panel, and who can argue with that? At any rate,
the DFC got the Barrister Smackdown from Keane and Co., so check it
out before it's all over. <B>A</B></P>

A sort of primordial weblog, this site once linked to three or four pages
that were generally so bad it made your monitor curdle. So if you're
wondering why all monitors these days come with anti-curdle defractors,
that's why. You might wonder why you'd <EM>want</EM> to be directed to bad
pages, but this was before Geocities made bad home pages a buyer's market. <B>B-</B></P>

This page, now lost forever as far as I can tell, was inexplicably popular back in the day. (Sept 23, 1995) It
took pandering to newbies to an entirely new level, going so far as
to explain how to move and click your mouse, as if people would have
gotten to the page in the first place by random quantum arrangement of
electrons. The popularity may have been explained in part by a glowing
endorsement from Rodney Dangerfield. The Web was really hard up for
celebrity endorsement back then. <B>D+</B></P>

Eve Astrid Andersson was the original Hot Web Babe, based on the fact that
she was female, had a Web page, and had memorized hundreds of digits of
pi. Andersson's star has been eclipsed, sadly enough, by the hundreds of
pay-per-peek Web sites with "cam" in the name, but know that there was
once a time when a woman's attractiveness on the Web was measured not
by how much skin she flashed at her QuickCam, but by how many numbers she
could stuff into her brain at once. <B>B</B></P>
