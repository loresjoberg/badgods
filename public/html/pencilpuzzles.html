<p class="ratingheader">Crosswords</p>
<p class="ratingbody">You know you've reached a special point in your path to adulthood when
you start doing symmetrical crosswords. For the first decade or so of
crosswording, your crosswords have no discipline, halfhazardly
crossing "duck" with "bunny" and "chicken," giving you words with
only one crossed letter so if you can't think of a "birthday treat"
you only have a single sad "a" to cue you in. Then, at some point
you graduate to the symmetrical crosswords and suddenly
you have know what country Khartoum is in. It's a rite of passage,
or at least a passage of writing. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Cryptic Crosswords</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I am told that the British version of crosswords are a different breed,
although I've never been to Britishania to see for myself. If the rumors
are true, the British have a masochistic streak of Chunnelesque proportions.
Sample clue from <cite>Games</cite> magazine: "Tabloids covering premiere
of <cite>Muppet Babies</cite>." The answer is "Pampers." Seriously.
Isn't that insane? The answer is arrived at through a combination of
anagrams, wordplay, and trafficking in the occult. It's wonderfully
twisted. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Word Find</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I did a lot of word finds as a kid, but I eventually realized that they
were only marginally more interesting than sorting my socks, and that's
only because I had the one pair of He-Man socks. If I had a couple more
pairs, maybe some Transformers socks too, the socks would win. Word
finds, in their most basic form, are just a matter of dogged patience.
If you just look at each letter very carefully in turn, you'll eventually
find all the words, but your zest for life will be tattered and limp. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Logic Puzzles</p>
<p class="ratingbody">My favorite part of the logic puzzles were the little cross charts where
you put the X to indicate that you've figured out that Mr. Brown's favorite
food is scampi. My second favorite part are the stupid things you have
to figure out, like, you know, Mr. Brown's favorite food. And whether he
eats it with a fork, knife, spoon, chopsticks, or antique olive tongs.
The logic part is fun too, but it runs a distant third. If I really
cared about logic all that much, I'd be doing something useful with it,
like either ending hunger or finding a way to make it more fun. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Cryptograms</p>
<p class="ratingbody">For years I avoided cryptograms because they seemed stupidly
impossible.  How the hell am I supposed to know what "cvxrwhi" is?
It could be "lizards" or it could be "panties." Any time I can't
tell the difference between lizards and panties I feel disadvantaged.
But after I tried a couple I realized they aren't that tough after
all. The bit in English where "I" and "A" are the only single letter
words is very handy. If I had to do a chat room cryptogram, where
"r," "u," and occasionally ">" are all words, I'd be screwed. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>
