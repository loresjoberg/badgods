<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Garter</SPAN><BR>
It's far too rare in this society that you find religious
covenants in conjunction with the throwing of undergarments.
Unless you're a Unitarian. The idea here is that whoever catches
the garter is supposed to be the next guy to get married, but 
I'd say that having the most will and determination to snatch women's
clothing out of the air is a good sign that you shouldn't give up
sowing those wild oats just yet. <B>B+</B></P>

What's a lifelong commitment without a bit of slapstick?
While we're at it, why not have the flower girl throw banana peels,
hand the reception line cream pies to throw, and have the person
performing the ceremony refer to the bridal couple as "youse guys"? <B>D</B></P>

It's very thoughtful of early wedding arrangers to provide a handy
moment of suspense for Hollywood to take advantage of. In dramas,
this is where the tragic lover reveals her true feelings, in comedies
this is where the wacky mother-in-law to be delights the audience with
a sassy outburst, and in science fiction...well, I can't remember
any notable science fiction movie weddings, but there's room for
something really great there. <B>B-</B></P>

Hey, any excuse to wear a tuxedo. Actually, these days it's about
the <EM>only</EM> post-prom excuse to wear a tuxedo, unless you
count being a British Secret Service agent at the Baccarat table.
Plus you get to make a toast, which is fun as long as you don't
screw up and call the groom beautiful and the bride lucky. <B>A</B></P>

Like a bride doesn't have enough to worry about without making sure her
outfit rhymes. Handy wedding tip: assuming your gown itself
is new, if you can borrow someone's old blue underwear and hit all
the bases without endangering the wedding album. There used to
be a bit on the end about "a silver sixpence in her shoe," but
it's a good thing it died out in this country at least, because
"Bicentennial Quarter" lacks panache. <B>C</B></P>
