Isn't this a bit out of character for Star Trek, particularly
Star Trek: The Next Generation? If Picard was set loose on
a Monopoly board, he'd try and establish peaceable diplomatic
relations with Marvin Gardens and give St. James Place wide berth
so that its culture could develop without interference. Hardly
the setting for a cut-throat game of property acquisition, gold-pressed
latinum or no. (Side note: the phrase "gold-pressed latinum" always
makes me think of "chicken-fried steak" for some reason. Someday
we will possess the technology to electronically change all occurrences
of the phrase "gold-pressed latinum" in the various series into
"chicken-fried steak," and that will be good.) <B>C</B></P></TD>

What, dear Liza dear Liza, is the point? Yes, the whole thing is
holo-foiled and embossed and translucentized and contains "multifaceted
dice" (as opposed to?), but what does that matter if the rent on 
Kentucky Avenue is still eighteen dollars? Real landlords charge more
than that to run your credit report. It's like building a space canoe. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

One of the goals of this game is to "run dealerships." This, I think,
underscores the problem with the Harley-Davidson marketing machine as of
late. The archetypical sweat-soaked, helmet-eschewing, leather-swaddled
Harley-riding badass is not someone you'd expect to aspire to run a
dealership, or for that matter do anything else associated with Monopoly
except perhaps go to jail. And even then not without a tussle. And yet
Harley is backing this board game, and various stuffed animals, and a <A
HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/aurora/van59020.html">ceramic teapot</A>, for
chrissake. If I were a Harley owner, I'd probably pretty annoyed at having
Kawasaki riders saying to me, "Harley-Davidson, Harley-Davidson...You mean
the ceramic teapot people?" <B>D</B></P></TD>

Finally, a truly American game! Own the National Parks!
Use their financial leverage to crush the owners of the other National
Parks! One can only hope, for real verisimilitude, that the cost
to buy the properties is listed as a "campaign contribution" and
there are Community Chest cards involving strip mining. <B>B</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">3-D Puzzle Monopoly</SPAN><BR>
The weeping and wailing can cease, because you can now
play Monopoly in senses-shattering 3-D. It's really dumb. Monopoly
tokens and houses are already "in 3-D," so all that's left is to 
give the board a lame raised center (making it harder to roll the dice)
and scatter a couple chests around. Plus it's a puzzle, which means you
have to work to assemble it, and it doesn't fold up. It would be harder
to come up with a dumber idea for a Monopoly game without adding a 
deadly contact poison. <B>D-</B></P></TD>
