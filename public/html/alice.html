<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tweedledee and Tweedledum</SPAN><BR>
The major cultural accomplishment of "T&T," of course,
is giving editorial cartoonists a cheap metaphor for
equally idiotic people on both sides of an issue. My question,
though, is this: How do you 'spoil' a rattle, especially
a nice new one? Leave it on the kitchen counter overnight?
Buy it everything it asks for and never punish it? Shouldn't
Tweedledee have taken responsibility for the raising of his
own rattle? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Alice</SPAN><BR>
I have to say I find Alice inexplicably charming, but
she's still kind of a pushover. She finds something labeled
"Eat Me," and down it goes. Someone hands her a flamingo and
tells her to start whacking hedgehogs, and she's all over that
surrealistic Victorian action. It's a good thing she doesn't 
get e-mail: "Alice saw that the reports she was to sell
were themselves on the subject of selling reports. It made
no sense to Alice, but she put her name at the bottom of the
list and mailed it to ten thousand people anyway. 'After all,'
she thought, 'If someone takes the time to put "MAKE MONEY
FAST" in the subject of a letter, there must be money to be made.'"

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mad Hatter</SPAN><BR>
"Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to
her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly
English." Baby, I've been there. One of the great things about
El Sombrerador Loco is the way he's drawn. It's perfect. Not
only can you tell he's a hatter -- and I've never even met a
hatter -- but you can tell he's mad, in the same way you can
tell that the guy lurching down the street with a windbreaker
tied around his head isn't exactly signaling all his lane changes.
And he's the one who came up with the "Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat"
poem. What more could you want? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Father William</SPAN><BR>
Father William, technically speaking, isn't actually in Wonderland.
Rather, he's a character in a poem, but that never hurt the 
Walrus and the Carpenter any. At any rate, Father William can
eat geese whole, do backflips, and balance eels on his nose, all
while maintaining perfect rhyme and scansion. In addition he
tries to get his son to buy dubious ointment and threatens to
kick him down a stairwell. If Father William had been in charge,
I doubt Tweedledee's rattle would have had any behavioral
problems. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pat the Guinea Pig</SPAN><BR>
I have to admit that I'm going to be unfair here. Power corrupts,
and the incredible sway that this space holds over the hearts and
minds of people worldwide only encourages me to use it to level
petty vendettas against sitcom stars from the Seventies. You see,
there was once a TV movie based on "Alice in Wonderland," and it
starred just about every actor who 
hit hard times about the time "The Carol Burnett Show" closed.
"Pat" was played by one Scott Baio. Now, I think you could make
a good argument that Lewis Carroll had never even <EM>seen</EM>
"Joanie Loves Chachi," but that one television event is enough
to sour Pat forever in my mind. So sad.<B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Queen of Hearts</SPAN><BR>
I like the Queen; she's found her method of coping with life --
beheadings -- and she's okay with that. It's kind of like creative
visualization, really; if there's something happening that
she doesn't dig on, she creates a world where the person responsible
has died horribly. And if nobody ever actually ends up headless,
well, you create your own reality. I really think there's some room
here for a new and potent form of therapy. <B>B+</B></P>
