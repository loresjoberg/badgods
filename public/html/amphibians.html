<p class="ratingheader">Frogs</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Frogs are a good comedy animal. They've got the tongue, the bulgy
eyes, the spindly legs. The whole "frog in the throat" gag, if you're
into recycling puns from 1918. A cat or a horse singing "Ragtime Gal" is
merely odd. A kick-stepping frog in a top hat is pure hilarity, at
least until it gets roped into shilling for "Charmed."  <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Toads</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Toads are kind of like sport utility frogs: uglier, slower, and somewhat
better at moving over rough terrain while not exactly being good at it.
I've been told by various publications that toads giving you warts
is a myth, and that no, it turns out they actually can. I've never tried
to track down the final word, though. It's not like having my hand
covered in toad urine is a guilty pleasure that I'm stifling until I
get the all clear. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Salamanders</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Ancient myths, and considerably less-ancient roleplaying
games, have salamanders as elemental creatures of fire,
which is odd given that all the salamanders in my peer group are fairly
moist. It's like deciding that the living embodiment of grace and 
beauty takes the form of a three-legged pug. Actual salamanders are
freaky in their own special way, though, being available in all sorts
of don't-eat-me colors and some of them sporting gills that make it look
like their brains are making a run for it.  <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Newts</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Apparently I have been living in a fog of deceit. I was always under
the impression that newts are in some way taxonomically different from
salamanders, similar to alligators and crocodiles. Turns out that
some salamanders get called newts, and some get called salamanders.
There's no consistent rule. I've run into a few stabs at guidelines,
but they strike me as the thin whine of scientific desperation. It seems
to me that there should be some standard of adorability, with the dividing
line between the salamander and the newt being based on the likelihood of
your mom letting you keep it. But I am, alas, not consulted in these things. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Sirens</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Apparently these are a form of salamander that has no hind legs and
lives permanently in water. Never leaving the water and calling yourself
an amphibian seems like the vertebrate equivalent of buying all your
rebellious punk outfits at Hot Topic. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Caecilians</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These guys are eerie. They're legless, burrowing amphibians that look
really unpleasant. They combine the creepiest aspects of worms, snakes,
eels, and that guy you knew in college who was always offering
massages to girls he barely knew. I can't help but imagine that one
of these in the old cot would make even the most grizzled longshoreman
screech like a smoke detector and waggle his hands in the time-honored
way of cartoon housewives. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>
