<P><BIG><B>Aquaman</B></BIG><BR>
Let's face it, Aquaman basically got suck for powers. His major shtick 
was the whole concentric-ring-exuding fish-control thing which allowed him to 
draft underwater lifeforms into his own personal war, which of course required 
the writers of the show to work a major marine disaster into every ensemble 
piece. This demonstrates a central flaw in including Aquaman on the 
team: having water-based powers is a pretty serious limitation, along the 
lines of a hero whose powers only work on weekends. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Batman</B></BIG><BR>
Batman gets extra points for having the best line in the entire 
history of the Superfriends. The villain was named Dr. Noah Tall or something 
equally ludicrous, and he and his evil little sidekick were posed as 
street-corner food vendors with a cart and everything. As part of their plan, 
they were attempting to get Batman to buy some chicken soup. This REALLY 
HAPPENED, DAMMIT! Anyhow, Batman, the dark night detective, the scourge of the 
underworld, assessing the situation with his keen crime-fighting brain, asks, 
in his deep, stentorian voice, "Is the chicken soup fresh?" It was a glorious 
moment. <B>A</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Superman</B></BIG><BR>
Oh, what are you going to say about Superman? He's got it all going 
on. It's really good that he's such a nice guy, because if I was in Superman's 
place, I'd be totally lording my powers over all the other Superfriends. "Hey 
Batman," I'd say, "Nice utility belt! Got anything in there that would help 
you lift an oil tanker? I didn't think so. Hey Aquaman! You realize I could 
pretty much kick ass over any sea creature you cared to summon, don't you? 
Wonder Woman! Your magic lasso makes me tell the truth: You suck!" So I 
suppose we should be grateful. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Wonder Woman</B></BIG><BR>
Wonder Woman was kind of a grab bag of powers and equipment, 
as if she had picked everything up from the superhero equivalent of the 
Sharper Image Catalog. She had the Bullet-Reflecting Bracelets ($29.95), the 
Mind-Control Lasso ($38.95) and of course the Invisible Plane ($150,000 plus 
taxes and license fees). That last one always got to me. It's like a regular 
plane, only it's invisible. It doesn't make HER invisible, though. So instead 
of this big plane, you see a nice, inconspicuous, flying, squatting 
woman. Huh. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Zan and Jayna</B></BIG><BR>
I don't know if it was ever fully explained why Wendy and 
Marvin were replaced by Donny and Marie Osmond in Spock ears, but then 
Wendy and Marvin's presence was never adequately explained in the first 
place. Zan and Jayna were a definite improvement, because not only were 
neither of them named "Marvin," they also had cool powers. Zan's ability to 
turn into water objects would have been a bit lame if not for the ice 
sculpture loophole, but Jayna definitely was happening with her animal 
transformation. Could have done without that Gleek organism, though.

<P><BIG><B>Wendy and Marvin and Wonder-Dog</B></BIG><BR> 
What? What? Why are these losers hanging out 
with the Superfriends? Did they win some sort of lame-ass contest? Are they 
somebody's cousins? Wendy didn't even TRY to fit in with the superhero 
crowd, and the best Marvin could do was a towel around his neck and a T-shirt 
that said "M." And then there was the dog. There's something really sad in the 
fact that the Superfriends were hanging out with Scooby-Doo wannabees for so 
long. <B>D</B></P>
