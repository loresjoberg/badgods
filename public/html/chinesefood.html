<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mu Shu</SPAN><BR>
I have serious problems with the pervasive mu shu
pancake inequity in this country. I have never been
in a Chinese restaurant that provides enough mu shu
pancakes for the mu shu in question. There's just no relation.
Within minutes, the pancakes have been devoured and there's
still a mountain of mu shu. Not that that stops anyone,
but it would be nice to get this worked out anyway. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sweet and Sour Pork</SPAN><BR>
Pork. Fried pork. Fried breaded pork.
Let's just go in for the bypass now and save ourselves the trouble
of separating our disposable chopsticks. Plus -- and this is
what makes Sweet and Sour worth savoring -- it's in a pink
translucent sauce. How often does one get to eat pink food outside
of birthday parties for nine-year-old girls? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot and Sour Soup</SPAN><BR>
I appreciate the tendency of Chinese restaurants to
include the flavors in their food names. Now if only
fast food restaurants would follow suit. Then we could
enjoy our choice of "Greasy and Salty Burger," "Greasy and Salty
Fries," or "Greasy and Salty Chicken Nuggets." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Szechuan Beef</SPAN><BR>
Szechuan anything isn't just a main dish; it's a diverting game
of "don't eat the little black peppers." The little black peppers
often disguise themselves as harmless and delicious vegetables, when
in fact they are death food. Even those who enjoy feeling their
tongues dissolve in wasabi or tabasco avoid the flaming death peppers.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fortune Cookies</SPAN><BR>
Fortune cookies have the least credibility of any prognostication
device with the possible exception of Faith Popcorn. People find
uncanny synchronicity in tarot cards, horoscopes, sometimes even
the Junior Jumble, but rarely if ever do you hear people say
"My God! It's true! I <EM>am</EM> admired by friends for my giving
nature!" That's why the whole "in bed" thing was invented.<B>B+</B></P>
