<P><strong>Extra Cheese</strong><BR>
<em>Extra</em> cheese? If you need <em>extra</em> 
cheese on your pizza, either a) the pizza service you patronize 
is made up of a bunch of skimping dairy-misers and you 
should find yourself another pizza source, or b) your dietary 
needs would better be served by simply eating a bowl of hot 
cheese. <strong>C-</strong></P>

<P><strong>Pepperoni</strong><BR>
Violently, tragically overrated. I'm convinced that the 
pepperoni tradition was begun by early pizza guys who wanted 
to foist the cheap, vile sausage off on the unknowing early 
pizza patrons, saving the good stuff for cute girls and especially 
heart-wrenching urchins. <strong>C</strong></P>

<P><strong>Sausage</strong>
<BR>Now <EM>this</EM> is a meat topping. If you get it at a 
good place, which is to say a place where you can distinguish 
the pizza crust from the refrigerator magnet that came with it, 
it can be a truly rich and rewarding food experience. And if 
not, it still beats hell out of the bright red grease-saucers they 
call pepperoni. <strong>B</strong></P>

<P><strong>Pesto</strong>
<BR>Are you <em>ready</em> for pesto? Can you 
<em>handle</em> pesto? I've seen strong men 
<em>crumble</em> before a good pesto pizza, begging and 
<em>drooling</em> to be allowed another bite! 
<em>Writhing</em> in the <em>torture</em> of pure basil 
ecstasy! You're <em>afraid</em>, aren't you? <em>You fear 
pesto! Bastard! Coward! Bastard!</em> <strong>A-</strong></P>

<P><strong>Little Red Pepper Flakes</strong>
<BR> Man, I love these. You know, the ones in the big shake-jar 
next to the Parmesan powder? You shake them all over your 
pizza slice and they taste like an invading pizza army. It's like 
eating pizza sacked by Ostrogoths. <strong>B</strong></P>

<P><strong>Anchovies</strong>
<BR>Let's give fish particles their due, shall we? They're not 
really very good tasting, but they serve the dual purposes of 
being a funny topping and being the topping nobody orders. 
Say you're telling a joke, and the guy in the joke orders a pizza. 
Just put anchovies on the pizza and it doubles the comedy, if 
it's a pretty pathetic joke in the first place.</p>

<P>As for the second point, the fact is that there has to be one 
topping that nobody orders, and if there wasn't anchovies, the 
entire Canadian Bacon market would vanish and Canada itself 
would collapse into ruin, forcing us to send them billions of 
dollars in aid just to keep the "For Better or For Worse" 
cartoons coming. <strong>B+</strong></P>
