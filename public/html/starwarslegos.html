There's something adorably intense about a bite-size Darth Vader.
The folks at Lego have done a wonderful job of translating Vader
into the Dinky Lord of the Plastic Sith, including a pseudo-cloth
cape and a mask that removes to reveal: scarred-up old pasty guy
regretful Anakin face! Looking impressively scarred, pasty and
regretful, I might add. <B>A+</B></P></TD>

I want Lego Stormtroopers! I want a bucketful of Lego Stormtroopers that
I can toss to children from a parade float! I want to line them up and
bowl Pok&eacute;balls at them! But there are none! What do I get instead?
Stinkin' Endor Forest
Troopers on their stinkin' speeder bikes! They're reasonably decent
interpretations, yes, but who wants a decent interpretation
of someone who can get beaten up by an Ewok? <B>C-</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Biggs</SPAN><BR>
Hey, it's Biggs! Biggs Darklighter! With his little mustache and helmet,
looking for all the world like a doomed member of some intergalactic
version of the Village People! Biggs has gotten pretty screwed on the
action figure front, so it's nice to see him get his moment in the
sun, even if he has to do it with no nose. <B>A</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Boba Fett</SPAN><BR>
Star Wars fans! At long last you can unmask Boba Fett! That's
right, his helmet is removable, showing his true face: nothing! That's
right, Boba Fett's true visage is a featureless jet black 
cylinder! Aaaaaagh!  Frightening! Yet lame! If Fett gets unmasked
in the prequels, Lego better be sending me a replacement head pronto! <B>B+</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frozen Han</SPAN><BR>
This isn't technically a figure, but rather a plank with an amusingly
pathetic image of Han sporting an expression that doesn't so much say
"the agony of being frozen alive" as "ate a dozen pickled eggs on a bar
bet." I recognize the limitations of the medium, but it would have been
nice if it had at least had little silvery Lego hands extending out.
Then you could put stuff in them and play "Jabba turns Han into a
decorative plant holder." <B>D</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tattooine Luke</SPAN><BR>
I like this. I like his plastic removable 'do that captures the
artificially full-bodied look that characterized the hairstyle everyone 
named "Luke" had in the seventies. I like the determined look on his face
that says "I may not have knees or individual fingers, but I am
going to rescue the galaxy from evil nonetheless." I like the careful 
and not altogether unsuccessful attempt to recreate his frumpy desert 
clothes. It's just a class act all around. <B>A</B></P></TD>
