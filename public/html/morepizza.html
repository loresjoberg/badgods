<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tomato</SPAN><BR>
Overkill. Seeing as all but the oddest pizzas are covered with pureed
essence of tomato, actual tomato slices add little to the effect.
This is especially true given that commercial
tomatoes have grown increasingly tough and pale over the
years, as if there were a historic merger of the vegetable and
sports equipment industries circa 1989, resulting in tomato-softball
"synergy." <B>C</B></P> 

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ground Beef</SPAN><BR>
"Sausage? No, no, that's too daring. Pepperoni? No, I wouldn't
want the neighbors to find out. Ham, maybe? What do you think I am, some kind of
radical Bohemian effigy-torching anarchist? No, we're going to
go with good old fashioned ground beef, just like Momma used to
brown. If it's good enough for soup mix casserole recipes, it's
by-God good enough for this weird-ass eye-talian food. What should
we have to drink with this, Bud Dry or Bud Ice?" <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Grated Packet Cheese</SPAN><BR>
I just want to start out by saying that I truly enjoy grated
Parmesan, and if the cheese dust they provided with your to-go
order resembled grated Parmesan in any way other than hue, I'd like
it too. But it doesn't. It tastes like non-dairy cheese-mimicing food product,
and it gives your pizza the same texture as you'd get by leaving
it on the floor of a junior high woodshop class for a good half-hour.
That is, if it were physically possible for pizza to exist in the
presence of junior high school students for more than five minutes.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Garlic</SPAN><BR>
The best advice on cooking I've ever heard is "Any dish can be improved
with the addition of either garlic or chocolate chips." I've tried the
chocolate chip pizza and it lacked something, which leaves this. The
power of garlic on pizza is such that adding garlic to pizza improves it
even if there's <EM>already</EM> garlic on it. I've tested this theory recursively,
adding ever more fresh garlic to my pizza, and I wasn't able to reach the
point of diminishing returns before my mere bodily exhalations started setting the
pizza box on fire.  Damn fine pizza, though. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chicken</SPAN><BR>
The disturbing thing about chicken on pizza is that it usually only shows up
when the pizza shop is creating some sort of ill-conceived International
Pizza of Mystery. The tomato sauce is replaced
by white sauce, Thai peanut sauce, or something equally disturbing. Vegetables
you can only get in upscale grocery stores in the flakier portions of
California are tossed on top of it, and inevitably the crowning glory is chicken,
because there are a lot of lacto-ovo-poultro vegetarians out there who associate
chicken with healthy living, even when it's drowned in cheese and bechamel sauce. 
Now, some of these creations can be pretty good, but that's not the point. The
point is that you can only take pizza so far before it ceases to be pizza and
instead becomes a member of the hors d'oeuvre family. <B>C+</B></P>
