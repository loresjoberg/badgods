Occasionally I'll see an interesting mustache in a movie or TV show
and I'll try to replicate it, but a fascinating transformation takes
place. A mustache that makes a movie villain look exotic, mysterious
or tough always, no matter what, makes me look like the guy behind the
hotel desk in I Love Lucy reruns. I know that mustaches look good on
some people - although Don Ameche and my dad are the only ones that come
to mind at the moment -- but the potential for tragedy is just too great. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

It's time for muttonchops to make a comeback, don't you think? Really, I
don't see how you can go wrong with facial hair named after meat. Plus,
once veejays and jaycees alike are sporting full, bushy muttonchops,
Chester A. Arthur can finally rest in peace and stop haunting my
carburetor. <B>C+</B></P></TD>

A simple set of sideburns can say so much. It can express solidarity with the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones, or if shaven into interesting shapes it can say
"I'm working up the courage to get a tattoo." It can denote an urge to
prove your virility without giving your girlfriend stubble burn, or it
can say simply "I work at Borders and this is all they'll let me get
away with." <B>B</B></P></TD>

You would think that a full beard would be the easiest thing in the
world. There's nothing to do but let that fucker grow and use the money
you're saving on razors to influence senators. A beard is a personal
thing, but in my case the problem is that in raw surface area most of my
beard is on my neck, so if I grow it all out I look like I'm harboring
some endangered form of rock-growing fungus on my face. So I still
have to shave my tender, milk-white neck with a cruel and expensive
slicing device. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Goatee</SPAN><BR>
It's just happy coincidence that I already had a goatee when the goatee
boom of the late nineties happened and venture capitalists where combing
San Francisco for goatees in which to invest. Sure, for a while there it looked
like goatees might just keep getting more and more valuable. We dared
to hope that perhaps the Goatee Economy would transform society, but I
think in our hearts we knew that it couldn't last. And yet, many of us
hung on to our goatees even as plunging goatee values made headlines
across the world. And even now there are pockets of us stubbornly
clinging to our goatees both in the literal and metaphorical sense,
those who insist that it was never about the money and the parties and
being interviewed by news-magazines as if our opinions mattered. It was,
and still is, about hiding our chins. <B>A</B></P></TD>
