<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lucky the Dog</SPAN><BR>
Lucky has reason to be happy, in spite of the fashion faux pas of
a spiked collar in fire-engine red. Being of similar 
dimensions as the rest of the family, he has attained equal status. 
He fits on the merry-go-round! He can sit behind the desk!
He can <EM>drive the ambulance</EM>! If the real world were more
like the Fisher-Price world, we'd have happier dogs and more people
bleeding to death on the freeway asphalt. <B>B+</B></P></TD>

I'm guessing on the relationships among the Little People, here. It's
not like you can check for a wedding ring. At any rate, The Standard
Fisher-Price Little Adult Male Person apparently went to the Charlie
Brown Beauty College for all his haircuts. But he seems to be happy
with his lot; wife, children, plastic car with circular depressions for
seats. It's all a Fisher-Price Person could ask for. <B>C</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Upset Freckled Boy Child</SPAN><BR>
It's nice of Fisher-Price to include a dissident among all the smiling
Little Constantly Happy People. A dissident with his hat on sideways,
so you <EM>know</EM> he's trouble. He's unquestionably the sort of
hard-hearted delinquent who steals apples from Old Man Croody's yard
and says "Nuts to you!" to authority figures. I like him. <B>A</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mother</SPAN><BR>
Mom's freaky. Her eyes are always closed, and her mouth is always open,
like some sort of deformed baby bird. Maybe the open mouth is supposed to
be a smile, but in that case she has pink teeth, which is its own set
of problems. Combine that with a stern German headmistress hairdo, and
you've got one unnerving hausfrau. Also she has no nose. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Little Girl</SPAN><BR>
Continuing with the Aryan theme of the distaff portion of the Little People
world, the little girl seems to be going for a "Heidi of the Non-Toxic Plastic
Alps" look, what with her milkmaid braids and the cute little ruff between
her head and thorax. No doubt once she reaches puberty her nose will fall
off and her eyes will glue shut and she'll end up just like dear old mom.
She may build a cocoon first, I'm not sure. <B>C-</B></P></TD>
