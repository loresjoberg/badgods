<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Adventure</SPAN><BR>
You're a dot. You have an arrow, which is actually a sword,
which you use to kill what appear to be giant ducks. Giant, at least,
compared to you, but you're a dot, so it's hard to figure scale.
This is what passed for epic on the 2600. Aside from the arrow/duck
thing, you also have to avoid a bat and collect keys to get
into a castle to find the magic chalice. Playing this game today,
one of the odd things is the lack of theme music. Any self-respecting
fantasy adventure these days has mind-numbingly repetitive theme
music. Except for the occasional beep, Adventure takes place in
grim silence, like a low-res German Realist film. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Breakout</SPAN><BR>
It's no coincidence, I think, that video games started to really
take off when they could be played solo. The first couple of
games, like Pong, were two-player affairs. But really, people
who actually have friends and a social life are the wrong
demographic to target. Once they started to aim for the
losers-with-disposable-income set, the quarters started to
flow freely. Breakout, then, is basically solitaire Pong.
You're not breaking out of anything; you're staying in one place,
pretending to destroy the walls that hold you in, only to give up
the freedom you've painstakingly won for another set of walls,
preferring a Sisyphian pseudo-challenge to true social and emotional
evolution. Sad metaphor, pretty neat game. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pac-Man</SPAN><BR>
This was the great Atari 2600 betrayal. The hype surrounding this
release was tremendous, fueled of course by the huge success of the
arcade game. And when the cartridge was finally released, sliding
it into the game console was like slipping a stiletto into your
own back. The game was pitiful. Pac-Man was shaped like a video
Wheat Thin, and instead of making cheerful munching sounds, he
honked. The ghosts were blocky and flickery, and the colorful
fruit had been replaced by a square "vitamin." Pathetic. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pitfall</SPAN><BR>
This may have been the biggest success of the whole drawn-out 2600
saga, as evidenced by the fact that survived its humble beginnings
and lead to Pitfall II, Super Pitfall, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure,
Pitfall 3-D, Pit-Tris, Pitfall Kombat, Pitfall in Pink: Barbie's Jungle
Shopping Quest, and the short-lived "Pitfall!" Saturday morning
cartoon show (1984-85). Not bad for a game where the high point is standing
on alligator noses. Certainly this was head and fedora above most
of what else was being offered at the time, and it was kind of fun,
but it didn't really have a big ending. You just collected all
the treasures and it was over. No accolades, no drawn-out credit
sequences, just no more game. <B>B-</B></P> 

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Superman</SPAN><BR>
The first of about four hundred billion video games starring
the Man of Steel, this took a lot of liberties with the
Superman mythos. For instance, Superman was bald, and looked and sounded like
a large wasp. Also, Kryptonite could, inexplicably, be counteracted by a kiss from Lois
Lane, who was only too willing to supply the needed antidote and would keep
on necking with you interminably if you picked her up. This was a basic
low-key gather-some-things-and-avoid-other-things game of the sort that
was mildly popular before computer resolution was high enough to accurately
render arterial spray, but I liked it. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Combat</SPAN><BR>
This is the game they handed out with the 2600, and it was
pretty tedious, It provided three challenges: shoot dots at each
other in biplanes, shoot dots at each other in tanks, and
shoot dots at each other in jets. Still, you've got to give
them credit for being the only home video game to date
with an instruction manual that incorporates the phrase
"Invisible Tank Pong." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tweedledee and Tweedledum</SPAN><BR>
The major cultural accomplishment of "T&T," of course,
is giving editorial cartoonists a cheap metaphor for
equally idiotic people on both sides of an issue. My question,
though, is this: How do you 'spoil' a rattle, especially
a nice new one? Leave it on the kitchen counter overnight?
Buy it everything it asks for and never punish it? Shouldn't
Tweedledee have taken responsibility for the raising of his
own rattle? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Alice</SPAN><BR>
I have to say I find Alice inexplicably charming, but
she's still kind of a pushover. She finds something labeled
"Eat Me," and down it goes. Someone hands her a flamingo and
tells her to start whacking hedgehogs, and she's all over that
surrealistic Victorian action. It's a good thing she doesn't 
get e-mail: "Alice saw that the reports she was to sell
were themselves on the subject of selling reports. It made
no sense to Alice, but she put her name at the bottom of the
list and mailed it to ten thousand people anyway. 'After all,'
she thought, 'If someone takes the time to put "MAKE MONEY
FAST" in the subject of a letter, there must be money to be made.'"
<B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mad Hatter</SPAN><BR>
"Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to
her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly
English." Baby, I've been there. One of the great things about
El Sombrerador Loco is the way he's drawn. It's perfect. Not
only can you tell he's a hatter -- and I've never even met a
hatter -- but you can tell he's mad, in the same way you can
tell that the guy lurching down the street with a windbreaker
tied around his head isn't exactly signaling all his lane changes.
And he's the one who came up with the "Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat"
poem. What more could you want? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Father William</SPAN><BR>
Father William, technically speaking, isn't actually in Wonderland.
Rather, he's a character in a poem, but that never hurt the 
Walrus and the Carpenter any. At any rate, Father William can
eat geese whole, do backflips, and balance eels on his nose, all
while maintaining perfect rhyme and scansion. In addition he
tries to get his son to buy dubious ointment and threatens to
kick him down a stairwell. If Father William had been in charge,
I doubt Tweedledee's rattle would have had any behavioral
problems. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pat the Guinea Pig</SPAN><BR>
I have to admit that I'm going to be unfair here. Power corrupts,
and the incredible sway that this space holds over the hearts and
minds of people worldwide only encourages me to use it to level
petty vendettas against sitcom stars from the Seventies. You see,
there was once a TV movie based on "Alice in Wonderland," and it
starred just about every actor who 
hit hard times about the time "The Carol Burnett Show" closed.
"Pat" was played by one Scott Baio. Now, I think you could make
a good argument that Lewis Carroll had never even <EM>seen</EM>
"Joanie Loves Chachi," but that one television event is enough
to sour Pat forever in my mind. So sad.<B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Queen of Hearts</SPAN><BR>
I like the Queen; she's found her method of coping with life --
beheadings -- and she's okay with that. It's kind of like creative
visualization, really; if there's something happening that
she doesn't dig on, she creates a world where the person responsible
has died horribly. And if nobody ever actually ends up headless,
well, you create your own reality. I really think there's some room
here for a new and potent form of therapy. <B>B+</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Corn Dogs</SPAN><BR>
There's obviously nothing in American cuisine so bad for you that it
won't be battered and deep-fried. I'm sure the only thing preventing
"Fried Breaded Mayo 'N' Butter Nuggets" from hitting a Denny's appetizer
sampler near you is that they dissolve in the vat. Corn Dogs are an
ancient and honorable manifestation of the will to fry. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dippin' Dots</SPAN><BR>
For the uninitiated, "Dippin' Dots" these are horrid little nodules of
some substance similar to ice cream, but without the part where it's
good. They're like sweet large-curd cottage cheese. Most amusing of all,
Dippin' Dots are billed as "The Ice Cream of the Future," as if Picard
is going to walk up to the food synthesizer and say "Ice cream. Wait,
no, Dippin' Dots." <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pizza</SPAN><BR>
Amusement park pizza is among the most oily, indigestible manifestations
available of a dish that was never noted for being easy on the stomach
in the first place. When combined with various rides that are the
essentially huge bar blenders, it's a half-digested disaster in the
making. If amusement park janitors ever go on strike, I suggest putting
"Stop serving that skanky pizza" over wage and benefit considerations. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cotton Candy</SPAN><BR>
There's not much sadder in the world of tourist-trapping than amusement parks
that have stopped making their own cotton candy by hand, and instead
just pass out plastic bags of factory-spun sugar.  The tradition of
cotton-candy swirling goes back hundreds of years, as evidenced by the
intricate and laborious "candy looms" being run at every colonial fair. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Funnel Cake</SPAN><BR>
One great thing about traditional fairs and amusement parks is that
they place more emphasis on entertaining preparation of foods
than they do on the foods themselves. As evidence we have the
aforementioned cotton candy, huge winding taffy machines, and 
funnel cake. It's made by dripping dough into a huge vat of oil!
Why that's entertaining I'll never know, but it is. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cars May Not Be Painted in Psychedelic Colors</SPAN><BR>
This, I have to say, was a huge disappointment, given that I traditionally
celebrate moving into each new apartment with a re-enactment of the
"Can You Picture That" number from The Muppet Movie using my 1997
Toyota Corolla in lieu of a Studebaker. Thwarted in this, I
am forced instead to stand atop it and sing "Never Before" in a Miss
Piggy voice, and I don't see how that's going to make my neighbors
any happier. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No Drinking in the Common Area</SPAN><BR>
Looking around the apartment complex, I can only assume that I got a bad
copy of the rental agreement and that the actual rule is "No drinking
in the common area unless you have your shirt off." Or possibly,
"No drinking in the common area, except for watery American beer, which
frankly is so low in alcohol it can practically drive in some states." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No Bottle or Cans in the Window</SPAN><BR>
The rules thus far, taken as a whole, remind me of a high-strung
upper-class woman desperately trying to cover up for her husband's
alcoholism. "For God's sake Henry, it's bad enough that you've turned
yourself into a pathetic mockery of adulthood, but do you have to ruin
my life, too? I'm not asking that much, dammit! Just keep your drinking
inside, your stinking cans and bottle off the window sill, and for Christ's
sake don't go on one of your benders and paint the car fluorescent pink
again! Just do that for me and you can drink yourself to death for all
I care!" <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No Slamming of Refrigerator Doors</SPAN><BR>
This comes well within the category of "Things I had no interest in doing
until they were forbidden to me." I've never been mad enough at the
contents of my fridge to slam the door, although I once had some
liverwurst that pissed me off pretty bad. And refrigerators have
that puffy lining around the door that keeps them from slamming effectively
anyway. But now that I've been expressly told not to slam it, I feel
put out and ready to take this one to the Supreme Court. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No Snorkels in the Pool</SPAN><BR>
I'm really perplexed by this one. Do they consider snorkels unsightly?
Dangerous? Perverse? Does the property owner just refuse to believe that
the word "snorkel" really exists? I suppose it could be to prevent people
of slipping on snorkels left by the side of the pool and cracking their
fool heads open, but there's no rule against, say, toy firetrucks. Weird. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Apartment Must Be Used Solely as a Dwelling Unit</SPAN><BR>
I assume that by this they mean that it must be used only as a home
and not as, say, the headquarters and production center for a Web-based
comedy magazine. Once again I find myself living in the shadowy boundaries
of a rental agreement, where right and wrong give way to questions of
whether I'll get my deposit back. It's a hard life, but it's the life
I've chosen. <B>D-</B></P>

Someday I hope to be known -- like the noble baboon -- for
my large, razor sharp fangs and colorful buttocks. "That
Lore," I want to hear people say. "He certainly has strikingly
vibrant  ass-cheeks, but he'll flay you with his fangs if
you cross him." Not that I'd actually flay anyone. I'd probably just
use my fangs to open beer cans  and make indentations in the soil 
for planting pumpkin seeds. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Japanese Snow Monkeys</SPAN><BR>
These guys are really one-trick monkeys. A few shots of them
up to their neck in hot water and people mistake that for
personality. I'm from California and I can assure you that
having personality is not a prerequisite for getting into
a hot tub. All that's required is a willingness to be seen
naked and a tolerance for white wine. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pygmy Marmosets</SPAN><BR>
This is the smallest monkey in the world. It's tiny! Ladies
and gentlemen, this is a <EM>hand-held monkey</EM>! The applications
boggle the very mind. To begin with, you could use it to distract
anyone from anything. "Excuse me, Mr. Rampaging Killer? Why don't
you put down the gun and take a look at this <EM>hand-held monkey</EM>?
Does it not have clever little forepaws? It eats gum and sap!"
It would be a lot like those old comic book ads where superheroes
defeat one-shot villains with fruit pies, only better. Because it
would have a monkey. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Orangutans</SPAN><BR>
I dunno. These don't do it for me. Sure, they scat sing in
Disney adaptations of Rudyard Kipling works, and they beat up
bar patrons in Clint Eastwood films but I dunno. I think the
thing that bugs me is when they "smile" in various trained-ape
bits. That is not a smile. If I had to define it precisely, I'd
have to put it in the "tortured, soul-searing deformed grimace"
category. And don't ever get me started on the "kissy face." <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rhesus Monkeys</SPAN><BR>
Also known as the "experiment monkey." They've even had a
blood categorization named after them, which is just as well
because I, for one, would not want to be known as "Chimp Positive."
The good news is that if we ever give rhesus monkeys health care
plans, we should be able to cure pretty much anything they get. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pollywaffle</SPAN><BR>
Hey, not bad. You'd think that American candy would have covered all
reasonable permutations this side of fudge-dipped yak nougat,
but they've somehow overlooked "Choc-coated marshmallow filled wafer,"
more's the pity. "Choc" in this case refers to something listed on the
ingredient label as "compounded chocolate," which sounds like something
you'd earn at the First Bank of Snackville but which is actually a
combination of chocolate and things you normally would specifically
request to be kept out of your chocolate. But hey, it's Pollywaffle! <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jaffas</SPAN><BR>
More "choc," this time in the form of "choc-orange in a crisp shell." I
couldn't figure out what made the orange aspect of this candy so odd
until I realized that it tastes more or less like real oranges, which is a
rarity in the world of snack foods. Anyway, the back of the package claims
that if you laid all the Jaffas sold in one year end to end, "you'd eat
your way from Darwin to Hobart." I can only assume these are the names
of a lovable pair of talking dachshunds from a children's television show.
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tim Tam</SPAN><BR>
One of the least disturbing of the items shipped to me, these are
chocolate biscuits ("biscuits" being the Australian term for what we
call "empty calories") coated in chocolate with some sort of chocolatey
substance between them.  Like most of these items, they seem to contain
some sort of secret mega-sweet ingredient that makes my pancreas throb.
I think it's called "cane sugar."  Heaven knows I'm used to sweet
stuff, but a few bites of these and I feel like I've been mugged by
an Oompa-Loompa. <B>B</B>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mint Slice</SPAN><BR>
Whoa, hey! These are great! These are mint-chocolate cookies and -- I'm
bordering on treason here -- they're better than the Thin Mints the Girl
Scouts hawk. This is because they've managed to coax the minty goop from
Junior Mints into immoral cohabitation with a cookie in a disreputable
hotel of chocolate. I'd love to see what the people responsible for
these things could do with Do-Si-Dos. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cherry Ripe</SPAN><BR>
As if the words "Cherry Ripe" in big yellow lettering weren't enough,
the package also explains that this candy bar contains "Ripe Juicy
Cherries."  I don't know if there was some scandal involving underripe
cherry treats in Australia's history or if we're just supposed to admire
their patience, but comes across as overcompensation either way. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Picnic</SPAN><BR>
I was relieved to find out that this contains neither fried chicken nor
potato salad. To the contrary, it's actually a pretty reasonable
log o'candy, somewhat reminiscent of a 100 Grand Bar, except without
being conveniently halved. More package fun: a suggestion that you
"please dispose of empty package thoughtfully," which puts me in
the mind of considering the motif of duality in the works of

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stacking Doughnuts</SPAN><BR>
I always had a vague sense of disappointment that these weren't
actual doughnuts, but what the hell, they're pretty satisfying
to gnaw on anyway. The tapered pole is a little fascist, I should
be able to stack them small-to-large if I want, but if that gets too
frustrating, they also ricochet in a satisfying manner when thrown. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Busy Box</SPAN><BR>
Or whatever these things are called. I'm referring to the Infant Central
Control Panel with the honk button and the spinning barber pole thing and
the dial that makes the clicking sound and the crappy hazy mirror but
what do you care you're a baby it's not like you need to apply mascara
or pimple medicine and the thing that jingles when you spin it. It's
a heady experience. I don't know why executives in need of desktop amusement
don't just get one of these. I guess it would just be weird to go
"Squeek! Squeek! Dammit, Anderson, where are those quarterly reports?
Honk! Squeek! Ding!" <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Puffy Vinyl Books</SPAN><BR>
I don't know whether this really counts as a toy, but that's why
it's waterproof; babies don't discriminate among toys, books, 
food, and random items that must be pounded on while yelling. 
So baby items tend to be universally colorful, stain-resistant,
and reasonably durable. Puffy vinyl books are all of the above,
plus they usually have some sort of baby animal theme. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gloworm</SPAN><BR>
It's this thing you hug and the face glows. That's all well and good,
but what happens when the child grows up and needs to learn that it 
takes more than a hug to make a loved one's face glow? It takes
commitment and tolerance and a superhero-esque radiation accident
and these are the values infants these days are sorely lacking. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shape-Matching Ball</SPAN><BR>
These are sort of like Perfection without the time limit. If
there was a game called "Adequacy," it would be like this.
I guess circa one year is too early to expect perfection
at anything besides drool bubbles, and precious few retain their
mastery of those into adulthood. That may be due to a lack
of drool-related challenges coming from the minds at Milton Bradley.
I may be thinking about this too hard. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Round</SPAN><BR>
I'm not sure what purpose these are intended to serve. Do people get 
in a lot of hole-punch accidents? Wouldn't a standard rectangular
Band-Aid adhere better? My theory here is that as a result of 
playing with peg-and-hole toys between story time and snack time as toddlers,
we as a culture now have a primal need to match up shapes, even in
minor medical emergencies. If there were any reasonable way to get a
flesh wound in the shape of a rhombus, we'd probably have rhomboid
bandages in the variety pack as well. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fingertip</SPAN><BR>
Nice to see the folks in R&amp;D earning their stock options, but I remain
unimpressed. I'm a tolerant man when it comes to first aid, but I think we've
coddled our paper cuts for too long. There's only one proven way to get a
Band-Aid to stay on your finger, and that's to wrap it so tightly that
your fingertip turns the color of cranberry juice cocktail, thereby
shifting your worries from infection to amputation. All the
intricately-shaped specialty bandages in the world won't change that.
<B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Small Rectangles</SPAN><BR>
If your cut, burn, abrasion or pimple scab is to small that you
can cover it up with one of these, you can probably safely ignore it.
And if you're going for the sympathy ploy, which I suspect is where
a hefty portion of the world Band-Aid flow goes, you may as well
go for one of the big ones and score the maximum amount of concerned 
looks you can get without breaking out the gauze.<B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Big Rectangles</SPAN><BR>
These are everything do-it-yourself medical treatment should be. They're
sterile, easy to use, and they make loss of bodily fluids fun! Although
in all fairness, I should say sterile <EM>or</EM> easy to use, but
not both. I've never been able to get the hang of attaching the
thing to my body using only the easy-peel backing; I either end up
missing the laceration in question by a centimeter or so, or
dropping the damn thing on the floor. I doubt that touching the
sticky bit is going to end up inducing gangrene, but it's the
principle of the thing. Band-Aids are as close as I'm likely to get to 
performing elective surgery, and I want to do it right. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Illustrated</SPAN><BR>
While I understand the principles behind these ("Anything children
touch must have merchandised cartoons on it"), I'm concerned about
the psychological impact. Do we really want pain and blood loss
associated with My Little Pony in children's minds? Do we really
want to hand disaffected Lit majors yet another vivid metaphor
with which to describe their disaffected childhoods? ("I looked down
and saw Bert and Ernie covering my wound, just as
so-called 'happiness' and 'togetherness' concealed the oozing
pus of hypocrisy that I called my family.") It's just a little odd.

Having addressed the important issues of deep-frying and cheese many times

the relative and absolute virtues of barbecue sauce, drawn butter, and
chocolate milkshakes as dipping material for french fries. I'm not sure

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Joker</SPAN><BR>
The Joker, depending on who's writing him, has two modes:
the "murderous clown genius" mode, where he's Batman's
deadliest and most wily arch-foe, or the "Rip Taylor unchained" 
mode, where he's basically a lawless prop comic. The latter is
typified by Caesar Romero's Joker in the old TV series, who once tied 
Batman to the inside of a giant coffee pot in order to kill him. An
interesting metaphor for many people's lives to be sure, but an
ineffective deathtrap. Yeah, the more sinister versions of the
Joker don't end up killing Batman either, but at least in those he 
takes out some innocent bystanders. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Two-Face</SPAN><BR>
I'd think you could defeat this guy by just playing up
the indecision. "Do you want to hold that axe left-handed or
right-handed before you kill me with it? Do you want to use
an overhead swing, or a side-swing? Do you want to start hacking
at my extremities, or shall we just lop off my head and get
on with things? Heads or tails, bucko?" 
After a while he's so exhausted from coin-flipping
that he has to go lie down on either the bed or sofa, and you're home free.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Penguin</SPAN><BR>
Hmm. Short, slow, harmless, vaguely comical. Did The Penguin
choose his name at random or does he have some real bad-guy
self-esteem issues to work out? At any rate, The Penguin started
out as a chubby guy in a dumb suit with a pointy nose, and he's
pretty much stayed there despite all Burton-inspired attempts
to hip him up. I mean, umbrellas? Please. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Clayface</SPAN><BR>
Dumb name, cool villain. This was an evil guy made of clay who
could sculpt himself into anything, the better to pound the Caped
Crusader into spandex-clad bodily humors. Clayface hasn't made it into
the movies yet. One would presume that this is partly due to
cost -- it's cheaper to slap Arnold into a plastic suit than it
is to create a morphing clay guy -- and partly due to the fact
that it's hard to sell a movie using a big star when 
the star in question is obscured by fifty pounds of clay. 
"Look! It's Sylvester Stallone! Or Michael Jordan!

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Catwoman</SPAN><BR>
You know, I've just never gotten into the homina-homina thing that
Catwoman seems to inspire in so many, not the least of whom is
Batman himself. I think I could create a much more stable
and rational long-term relationship with, say, Xena. The meow,
hiss, claw, whip, steal, flip, form-fitting black Bad-Guy-Au-Go-Go

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Riddler</SPAN><BR>
Okay, I've got it figured out. I'm going to call myself "The Non-Riddler,"
and I'm going to do everything the Riddler would do, but I'm not going to
give out any damned riddles. Judging from the fact that it's the Riddler's
own clues that inevitably give him away, I figure this is going to
leave the Dynamic Duo sitting in the Batcave playing Freecell on the
Bat-computer while I'm out crime-spreeing. I can retire after a
couple weeks of this, and Batman can go back to defeating villains
who provide four-color pamphlets detailing their upcoming capers.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</SPAN><BR>
Ben and Jerry deserve, at the very least, oral sex for giving
the world Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream. The amazing
thing about this flavor is that it's been in front of us, lo,
these many years; at any point, any one of us could have taken
a cardboard bucket of vanilla ice cream and a pre-prepared refrigerated
dough log and made this, but we didn't. And why didn't we?
Because we are mere losers when compared with the keen,
milkfat-soaked minds behind Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coffee, Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz</SPAN><BR>
This is the all-time winner of the "Dumbest Ben and Jerry
Flavor Name" award, edging out "Phish Food" and "Pistachio
Pistachio" with the decision to make "BuzzBuzzBuzz" one word.
This is a pretty good flavor, if you're into coffee ice cream,
but the decision to add real coffee grounds -- or, as they call them,
"bean flecks" -- is a bit dubious. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cool Britannia</SPAN><BR>
This is a great flavor. It's lighter than some of the "dark chocolate
ice cream with fudge goo and chunky sugar cubes" flavors, while still
remaining decadent. It also manages to hold up the English theme
very well, managing to incorporate distinctly British flavors (or, 
more accurately, "flavours") without resorting to "Banger Bits." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chubby Hubby</SPAN><BR>
The weird thing about this ice cream is that it started as a practical
joke, a spoof flavor designed to be barely edible. And yet Ben
and Jerry, getting wind of this, made it into an actual flavor. A good one!
A perfectly decent ice cream made with peanut-butter-filled pretzels,
in a world where most manufacturers can't come up with a decent
vanilla. At this point I'm willing to assume that Messrs. Cohen and
Greenfield could make a decent pint of ice cream out of sweet-and-sour
sauce and "corn niblets." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wavy Gravy</SPAN><BR>
Another close runner-up in the "lame name" competition, and
the winner of the "Send a Rhino Into Insulin Shock" contest.
I thought "gravy" was a poor choice of words to have in the name
of an ice cream flavor until I tried it. It's very gravy-like.
It gives you the same "my pores don't work anymore" feeling
that too much gravy can impart. It's really good, but it takes
a dedicated milkfat maven to toss back a whole pint. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chunky Monkey</SPAN><BR>
This is your basic prototype for a B&J ice cream flavor. It has:
1) A rhyming, playful, yet completely unappetizing name. 2) At
least one really odd ingredient. (Banana ice cream? Who eats
banana ice cream?) 3) Chunks. All that, plus it's gosh-all-tasty.
If it were named after a liberal icon it would be the quintessential
B&J. Maybe if they called it "Chunky Chomsky." <B>A-</B></P>

Frankly, if you're really sorry, you have no place in the cut-throat,
little-metal-dog-eat-little-metal-dog world of board games. <!-- What  saves
this game, however, is the little dice popper thing. I love the little

"Battleship" wins the award for "most technological advances added

explosion noises, you've got your 3-D CD-ROM Battleship with explosion
movies, you've got your networked online Battleship. (I played
online Battleship ten years ago. "Hey Dave," I'd say into the phone,
"B-3.") A hundred millennia into the future, when we're all a

we'll be playing Battleship for Hive Minds with Explosion Vibes.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scrabble</SPAN><BR>
I really love Scrabble. It's like "Battle of the Sumo Vocabularies."
I get unpleasantly competitive. Triple-word-score
squares tremble in my presence. I once tried to pass "ultrarunty" off
as a legal word. This is a game I'd love to play online, except that
the possibilities for cheating are incredible. I have no desire to
be trounced by a ten-year-old with a Pentium II and a search routine.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mouse Trap</SPAN><BR>
Great game, except for the fact that it <em>never works</em>. It
just <EM>doesn't.</EM> The diving guy misses the tub, or the hand doesn't whack
the bowling ball hard enough, and that's assuming you have all the
damned pieces. At least most people are smart enough to not actually
play the game; instead they just assemble the contraption, thus determining
that it doesn't work in two minutes instead of thirty. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chutes and Ladders</SPAN><BR>
Ooh! A morality play, set in cardboard! Save a kitty, go up! Steal
money, go down!  I think they should just admit that
this is a religious metaphor and have a space where the losers burn
in Hell. Or better yet, have "Chutes and Ladders, Dante's Inferno Version"
where the players are struggling to escape such punishments as
being immersed in excrement, trying to reach
the first level where they can hang out with Virgil and Socrates
in relative non-torture for all time. Take that, pre-school! <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pictionary</SPAN><BR>
The first thing one has to learn about Pictionary is that it's
an incredible disadvantage to be an artist. Whenever I play, I
end up trying to make pictures with perspective and shading
while my opponent simply draws from the "hastily drawn stick figure"
school of illustration and carries the day. It does have its
rewards though, such as when my lovely tableau of Lincoln's 
assassination ended up winning for the clue "booth." <B>B+</B></P>

<BIG><B>Air Blower Things</B></BIG><BR>
This is that little vent on the bowling ball receiving
unit where you put your fingers to dry off the sweat that accumulates from
the sheer tension of playing such a challenging game in borrowed shoes.
For me, these are one of the main pleasures of the game. I like to pretend I
went to get a manicure between frames and I'm drying my nails. In fact, I'm
so into this part of bowling that I can't use those hand dryers they have
in cheapskate public restrooms because it gives me this incredible urge to
go bowling, which frightens and alienates my friends. <B>B+</B></P>

<P>
<BIG><B>Beer</B></BIG><BR>
Beer is one of the main selling points of bowling. Bowling, along with
softball and darts, is one of the premier beer sports. It sounds fun, but
there's a catch: the beer served at bowling alleys is swill. It's possible
that the watery nature of bowling alley beer is due to safety concerns, to
keep patrons from getting wasted and loosing 16-pound, four-hole bowling
balls at each other's heads, but more likely it's just part of the greater
rule that you can't get decent beer anyplace where you find a lot of people
with their names on their shirts. <B>D+</B></P>

<BIG><B>Brunswick</B></BIG><BR>
For years I referred to that big plank that came down and swept
away the seven or so pins I inevitably left standing as a "Brunswick."
Because, after all, that's what was written across the front of it.
Eventually it dawned on me that <em>everything</em> in a bowling alley has
"Brunswick" written on it: balls, ball return units, exceptionally devoted
employees, and so on. The Brunswick Corporation apparently has some sort
of lock on the bowling industry. That's okay, though, because "Brunswick" is
one of the coolest words in the English language or something very like it.
I wish it were a swear word so that I'd have more opportunity to use it.
"Get your Brunswick the Brunswick out of there, you Brunswick!" <B>A-</B></P>

<P>
<BIG><B>Communal Bowling Balls</B></BIG><BR>
The problem with professional bowling, of course, is
that the scores are too high. A strike is quite an epiphany for me when
I make my first one in six or seven games, but the empathetic thrill of
watching some guy on TV make a strike wears off after eight or nine in a row. My
solution is to make the professionals use randomly selected communal alley
balls. These things are great. Not only do the lighter ones come in all
sorts of gaudy Eva Gabor hues, but each and every one of them appears to have
been questioned under torture. I bowled one of my best games with a ball
that seemed to have a large bite taken out of it, with actual teeth marks
and everything. <B>A</B></P>

<P>
<BIG><B>Shoes</B></BIG><BR>
I don't buy this whole disinfectant scam. These shoes have been worn
by hundreds of people, from all sorts of cretinous walks of life, and they
figure a little spritz of whatever's in those cans is going to restore them
to springtime sanitary freshness. Uh-huh. That's like spending three weeks
sacking out in a public restroom then being offered a "Tic-Tac." Of course
there's the old "let's make them ugly so no one steals them" scheme. Aside
from the fact that in today's youth-oriented fashion world butt-ugly shoes
are a major coup, do they really think that anyone who's going to make off
with battered communal shoes is worried whether they go with his
Dockers? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Campfires</SPAN><BR>
Aside from coming away from them smelling like the smoking section
of a barbecue joint, there's very little to complain about concerning
campfires. They're warm, they've got that whole hypnoticy swirly thing
going, and they provide the appropriate level of lighting for looking
at people who have been in the woods all weekend. And they enable
roast marshmallows, which are essential to robust living. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hiking</SPAN><BR>
It's not that I'm against scenic vistas. It's just that if I have to hike
for a half-hour to get to them I'd just as soon look at them through
a Viewmaster. Walking is fine, I like walking, but hiking is walking
in areas with insects and steep inclines while carrying dried fruit,
and I'm not down with that. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tents</SPAN><BR>
I'm conflicted here. I have to admit that, in action, it's pretty cool
that you can turn a few ounces of aluminum and vinyl into a happy
little suspension domicile. The Boy-Scout style pup tent has all
but disappeared, to be replaced by curvy art projects in jaunty colors.
On the other hand, having put up a tent you're sort of obliged to
sleep in it, and I'm a big fan of the "biggest, hugest, most comfy
bed you can possibly afford" school of slumber. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Camp Stoves</SPAN><BR>
One thing that I do like about camping is that it's rapidly turning into
a display of miniaturized Jetsons-esque technology designed to help
you forget that you are, for some ungodly reason, spending an entire
weekend outdoors. Case in point; at a recent camping event I sort of
semi-accidentally attended, the selection of gas-powered cooking equipment
in evidence put my own actual indoor kitchen to shame. There was even a
gas-powered mini-oven out of which came hot cinnamon rolls. If someone
has brought a gas-powered blender they would have had all my appliances
covered and more. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Power Bars</SPAN><BR>
I knew that granola bars were the start of something insidious. When
they first came out it wasn't a problem, because they were basically
candy bars with texture. Many of them even had chocolate chips. A
granola bar with chocolate chips is, in essence, a Mr. Goodbar with
the ingedient ratio inverted. But it was only a matter of time before
some misbegotten soul decided to pervert the noble hand-held snack food
bar into something actually healthy, with all the grittiness and
density that implies. So sad. <B>D</B></P>

"Big on bubbles" ("Les bulles...on s'y conna&icirc;t!") is this candy bar's
catchphrase, and sure enough when you crack one in half it looks like a
chocolatey degenerative bone disease. I'm not sure why this is a selling
point; it tastes like plain old regular Canadian crappy chocolate (which

I know a lot of Canadians are great fans of the Smartie, but I'm just not
seeing the appeal as compared to M&Ms, except that Smarties have chimps
named Bob and Einstein ("Robert et Pasteur") on the package. Aside from
that, Smarties are like larger M&Ms with thicker shells, worse chocolate,
and no letters printed on them. Also, they come in more colours, but
in my view chocolate bits should not be pink. I'm still having trouble
adjusting to blue M&Ms. They do not float in water. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

This is chocolate-covered sponge toffee. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with

This is a good idea! ("Une bonne id&eacute;e!") It's chocolate with a
coffee-flavoured wafer center. My complaint, however, is that it could be more
significantly coffee flavoured. It could hold you down and make you sniff
its beans, but instead it just kind of gives you a whiff of coffee before

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fuzzy Dice</SPAN><BR>
The real debate is not over fuzzy dice versus no fuzzy dice.
The real debate is over <EM>white</EM> fuzzy dice versus
<EM>pink</EM> fuzzy dice. You see, your average 50's throwback
T-Bird wannabee will go for the plain old regular white fuzzy dice,
crank up the Billy Joel and/or Huey Lewis and go cruising. It
takes the sort of man who's really comfortable with his sexuality
to dare to use display the fuzzy pink dice. This is the same sort
of hell-with-what-others think attitude that inspired young men
to spend hours on their hair, wear tight jeans, and wiggle their
hips in public in the first place. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Air Fresheners</SPAN><BR>
I don't think I need to point out that an enclosed space with
a pine-shaped scent exuder, the air does not become fresh. It
becomes chokingly pine-scented. Which is not to say that lethal
pine levels are not preferable to some of the car smells I've encountered.
 At least the traditional "tree
that smells like pine" has a sort of aethetic logic. Less
comprehensible are the trees that smell like baby powder, and
the Tasmanaian Devils that smell like anything other than
a carnivorous marsupiual. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sunshades</SPAN><BR>
No fewer than two times in my life have I noticed a car, 
empty, sitting in a parking lot with a sunscreen saying in
big red letters "EMERGENCY. PLEASE CONTACT POLICE!" The emergency
in question appeared to be the crisis-level inability of the
car owner to figure out which side of the car faces out. It's not

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dash-Mounted Notepad</SPAN><BR>
"Note...to...self. Don't be...such...an...inattentive jerk...while

The great thing about Crazy Eights is that, as a kid, I could inject new life and
vitality into the game by changing it to, say, Crazy Twos. Now that I'm several

can assure you that at seven, Crazy Eights and Crazy Twos were <EM>completely</EM>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Poker</SPAN><BR>
Ah yes, the Game of Kings. Particularly craggy-faced, vaguely oily kings named "Slick Eddie
the Sixth." There's a big caveat here, though. "Poker," in my estimation, is
comprised only of five-card draw, five-card stud, and seven-card stud. All other
Poker-like games are divided into "Games played by people who like to chit-chat
while pretending to play Poker," which includes Anaconda, Chicago, and any game
where anything is wild; and "Games played in card rooms that suck away your money
with the force and speed of a cartoon anteater," which includes Hold 'Em and
any Lo-Ball game. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">War</SPAN><BR>
What, pray tell, is the point? In your basic game of War, the entire interminable
game is pre-determined by the deal, so you may as well invent the War Resolution
Device, into which you can feed the deck and have it scan the cards and tell you
who won, thereby freeing up huge amounts of massively pointless time. People find
better things to do; science, philosophy, and the arts make vast advances, and
we're all thrust into an era of perfect peace and understanding like those
Jehova's Witness pamphlets where multicultural kids get to play with baby
pandas for all eternity. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Solitaire</SPAN><BR>
You know, I just can't play Solitaire with a deck of cards any more. I'm spoiled,
made soft and listless by Freecell and other computer solitaire games which
shuffle, deal, and tell you when you've completely blown it. I think it says
something about our society that we've managed to make killing time incredibly
efficient, allowing us to kill an hour of spare time in only fifteen minutes.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Go Fish</SPAN><BR>
This one has lost what little appeal it had. It's the "Candyland" of card games, but without

simplest rules this side of "52-card Pick-Up," which means you can play it with little
kids. However, in this age of Virtua Rapper Karnage 3-D, for a kid Go Fish probably holds all the
fascination of a symposium on exchange rate futures and their impact on the emerging
global economy. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Moon Roof</SPAN><BR>
Ah, yes, the <EM>moon</EM> roof. Let us commune with the
gentle healing rays of Mother Luna through a hole in the
top of our Dodge Neon. This is essentially a cheap sun roof,
which itself is an excessively conservative alternative to
a convertible, which in turn is just for those too faint of

for an inability to be transformed by a mysterious chemical 
accident into a super-speedster capable of running fast enough

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ten-Disc CD Changer</SPAN><BR>
I admit I'm speaking from ignorance here; I've never actually
had a CD player in my car. But looking at my own life, I realize
that my own trunk-opening habits are such that leftover picnic food
often converts to a toxic gas similar to those used for fumigation
in poorly-regulated South American countries before I get around to
removing it from my car. So my thought here is that I'd pick
ten CD's, load them up, and never change them again as long as I live.
Oh, sure, I'd get really tired of listening to "Best of Blondie" after
a few weeks, but it's all I can do to change the discs in my home
CD player, and that doesn't require me to find my keys. So I'd
end up listening to the same hundred-odd songs over and over again.
Admittedly, that's more variety than you get from your average
commercial station, but it's the principle. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Factory Air</SPAN><BR>
I like this because it's better than it sounds. In a world
where marketers are paid the big bucks to come up with
"Corinthian Leather" as a euphemism for "Naugahyde" which
itself is a euphemism for "Ill-Smelling Plastic Covering," 
it's refreshing to hear "factory air," which brings to mind
the choking scent of oil, ozone, and vending machine snack items,
instead of the more pleasant "built-in air conditioning." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Power Windows</SPAN><BR>
First off, "power" is a little bit overblown as a synonym for
"electric." You don't hear people referring to their "power toothbrush"
or "power can opener," do you? But in car ads, where every word is
designed to make you feel like you could overthrow a dictatorship
using only the latest model of their automobile, the windows are 
"power" in spite of the fact that they couldn't so much as crack
a nut. Alternatively, "power" could be a synonym for "likely to
break down at a financially inconvenient time." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Winch</SPAN><BR>
I'm not personally a fan of off-roading, and I don't care to
get myself involved in the American sport of pretending I
might very well go four-wheeling at any moment as soon as I
drop the twins off at soccer practice. But goshdamnit, I want
a winch. It doesn't matter what car I drive; if I was on a 
Vespa scooter I'd still want a winch. I have no idea what
I'd use it for; I don't have own any property with stumps
that need to be removed, and I don't need to bust any friends
out of an Old West jail cell. There's just something about
this industrial Batman car accessory that makes me want one. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Catamount</SPAN><BR>
What an odd name. It sounds like some Victorian writer of light opera

but if that's true, then why isn't Chicken of the Sea tuna called

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Puma</SPAN><BR>
I dunno. You'd think a hiker-dismembering wild cat would need a

Cat bats ball, ball goes around ring, cat bats ball again. Neither the ball

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Little Bits of Cardboard On a Wire</SPAN><BR>
This is the most successful toy I've yet run into on

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jingly Balls</SPAN><BR>
Why put a bell inside a cat toy? Does it put cats in the mind
of stalking the rare-but-majestic musical stoat? Do cats in
the wild routinely hunt and take down tambourines? The only purpose
it seems to serve is to rudely awaken the cat owner in the middle

<P><BIG><B>Cap'n Crunch with Crunchberries</B></BIG><BR>
What is a "Cap'n" anyway? The rank below 
a "Maj'r"? Anyhow, I am fully in favor of this cereal. Lovely 
does-not-occur-in-nature pink color to the "crunchberries," extra points for 
pretending that they're actual fruit, neat spokescharacter. The only real 
flaw is that it seems to be specifically designed to scrape three layers 
of skin off your gums with each bowl. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Cookie Crisp</B></BIG><BR>
Lame. It was a good concept, it could have gone somewhere, 
but the fact is that the cereal bits bear no closer resemblance to 
chocolate chip cookies than Fruity Pebbles do to actual rocks. Also, this 
Cookie Crook character is shamelessly derivative of the whole Trix Rabbit 
Cereal Theft genre, only instead of the kids looking after their own damn 
cereal they have an animated figure of authority to protect it for them. I 
am, however, an advocate of pouring milk on Chips Ahoy and eating that for 
breakfast. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Cocoa Puffs</B></BIG><BR>
The canonical chocolate sugar cereal. First off, it turns the 
milk chocolatey with eerie efficiency. When you've finished the cereal, 
that milk is damn chocolatey. Secondly, it actually does stay crunchy in 
milk. I don't know for how long, I haven't run tests, but its crunchy-
staying power is remarkable. Thirdly, "Sonny" is a fine cartoon 
spokesanimal in the no-pants tradition. And finally, and this is the vital 
point, it's the only cereal that openly admits to inducing hyperactivity. 
"Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs"  is obvious shorthand for "Parents, your 
children are going to be putting Keds marks on the walls after a couple 
bowls of this stuff." <B>A</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Honeycombs</B></BIG><BR>
In my childhood, the three main selling points of Honeycombs 
were: a) The individual cereal pieces are about an inch in diameter, b) 
They have a lot of surface area, and c) Large people will attempt to take 
it from you if you eat it. So, given these dubious advantages, it is 
unsurprising that I am  somewhat disappointed with the cereal. I've also 
never been terribly fond of honey-flavored breakfast cereal ("The 
delicious corn and oat cereal that's been mugged with honey!") so that was 
another point against. Still, it's the only cereal I know that actually 
improves in flavor when damp. <B>C</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Spider-Man Cereal</B></BIG><BR>
This one's relatively new, part of the continual march 
of tie-in cereals that appear on the market, make a few bucks, then fade 
away. Folks, they're not even trying with this one. The marshmallow bits 
are really sad. They don't look like anything. You read the side of the 
box, it explains what they are, and they STILL don't look like anything. 
The premium inside is a lame "trading card," and the cereal itself 
("Spider Webs") is just hexagonal frosted Rice Chex. Bleah. 
<B>D+</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Cinnamon Mini-Buns</B></BIG><BR> 
This is just not an exciting cereal. Let's face it, 
when you were a kid, Cinnamon Buns were just not as thrilling a breakfast 
sugar food as, say, doughnuts. So from the beginning you're got this kind 
of "capture the tedium" feeling. Then there's the interesting discovery 
that when reduced to miniature size, cinnamon buns resemble some sort of 
tidepool mollusk. The box I got came with a little superhero comic book, 
so they're obviously trying to hit the kid market, but I think it's pretty 
well doomed from the beginning.

Oh, for God's sake! This lame-ass marketing concept has all
the razzle-dazzle of a wet sock on the side of the highway.
It's sugary Rice Krispies with artificial colors. That's it.
Kelloggs' multimedia spectacular is basically Fruity Pebbles sans

worse, the sweetness has this off taste to it, like bad
maple syrup. Ugh. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosted Cheerios</SPAN><BR>
Okay, this is no more innovative than R&amp;D Rice Krispies, but at 
least the box isn't depleting our nation's valuable glitter resources. 
Still, the recipe is something you may very well have created
yourself at some point. Pour yourself a bowl of Cheerios. Add sugar.
Eat it. You have completed the Frosted Cheerios experience. So much

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Trix</SPAN><BR>
I want to tell you, I am upset about Trix. When I was but a lad, 
Trix was the Platonic ideal of cerealdom. A holy trinity of fruit flavors 
embodied as perfect spheres gave breakfast a spiritual quality you
don't often find while scarfing. Since then, Trix has been the
sad victim of the color and shape inflation that's infested the
industry. There are like half-a-dozen flavors, and each individual Trik
is vaguely fruit-shaped. The latest horror is "Wildberry flavor." If I were a
berry farmer, I would be trying to do something about the co-opting
of "berry" to mean "undefinably artificial." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">French Toast Crunch</SPAN><BR>
Man. French Toast Crunch is an eerie part of this complete breakfast.
The cereal bits are shaped like tiny slices of toast. It's like they
knocked over the Barbie Bakery or something. It smells like French
toast. In milk, it tastes like French toast. The problem is that,
as the name implies, it's crunchy. Crunchy French toast is actually
kind of unnerving and vile. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Apple Jacks</SPAN><BR>
I love these, and I couldn't possibly explain why. I think a lot of
it still has to do with the fact that even in this fast-paced,
fruit-flavored world, an Apple Jack is still an Apple Jack. Nobody's
tried to unload "Wild Berry Marshmallow Apple Jacks" on us. Also,
you've got to love a kid's cereal named after hard liquor. I keep
hoping they'll follow it up with "Kahlua Krispies." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cocoa Krispies</SPAN><BR>
A decent cereal with a serious case of high spokes-cartoon turnover.
I remember an Elephant named "Tusk," a moonlighting Snap, Crackle,
and Pop, and lately an excessively trendy monkey named Coco. In doing
research, I discovered that Cocoa Krispies has actually been hawked,
over the years, by <EM>three</EM> elephants, <EM>two</EM> monkeys (the first of which
was named Jos&eacute;, believe it or not), a caveman, the Rice Krispies
Elves, and Snagglepuss the pink cartoon lion. Huh. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">USA Olympic Crunch</SPAN><BR>
An ill-considered bit of breakfast jingoism, as
evidenced by the fact that, as far as I can tell,
it was only available in wholesale stores. 
USA Olympic Crunch (so named, I assume,
to distinguish it from Canada Olympic Crunch) is
just Lucky Charms with different shapes and about
one-tenth the marshmallows. Now if they had decided
to increase the number of marshmallows, perhaps
inverting the cereal-marshmallow ratio, then at least
it would have been a bold experiment. As-is, Patriotic
Sports Puffs are not my idea of a breakfasty good time.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Froot Loops</SPAN><BR>
One of the nicest things that ever happened to me
was when a then-girlfriend took it upon herself
to go through a box of Froot Loops and separate the
colors. She then gave the box, each color in
an individual baggie, to me. What wonders I did to deserve
segregated fruit cereal, I don't know, but I experienced
a thrill not unlike opening the fabled Ark of the Covenant,
except without the melting face bit. At any rate,
I was able to answer the Eternal Froot Loop question:
Do the different colors <EM>really</EM> taste different?
The long-awaited answer: Sort of. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosted Flakes</SPAN><BR>
Cereal, sugar, box, disturbing cartoon animal, worthless premium:
Frosted Flakes embodies everything it means to be sugary breakfast
cereal. In a world where new breakfast cereals rise up, shine
briefly, and are struck down by what Adam Smith called "The invisible
blood-encrusted two-by-four of the market," Frosted Flakes abide.
I do want to pick one nit, though: if you were playing basketball
with a skinny loser of a kid and a 6' 4" cartoon tiger with biceps
the size of the giant turtle at the petting zoo, and you got your ass
kicked, would you then be saying "Whoa! That kid's good!" or would
you instead be saying "We'd be doing pretty good too, if we had
a <EM>giant anthropomorphic jungle cat</EM> on our side!" <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rice Krispies Treats</SPAN><BR>
They taste better in milk than Chex Mix does, I'll give them
that. And come to think of it, actual Rice Krispies treats make
at least as much sense as part of this nutritious breakfast as
Pop Tarts do. But Rice Krispies Treats Cereal doesn't taste
like Rice Krispies Treats. It tastes, in a word, awful. Marshmallows
don't have the most natural flavor ever to wander down the gullet,
but whatever marshmallow substitute they devised to hold the
amphibian-egg-sac-like clusters of Krispies together is to marshmallows
as marshmallows are to fresh organic island-grown sugar cane. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch</SPAN><BR>
Weird. Eerie. Peanut buttery. The thing about Peanut Butter
Captain Crunch is that I don't really like it, except when
I'm eating it. When I'm eating it, I compulsively wolf down
the entire box at one sitting, then I go back to not liking it.
It's like some early-morning Jekyll-and-Hyde routine. Here's
an idea for a commercial for Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch:
They have characters that want to steal the cereal, characters that want to protect the
cereal, characters that are afraid the cereal will make them lose
their minds; why not a character who doesn't like the cereal until
some rosy-cheeked and trendily-dressed grade-schoolers shove it down
his throat, at which point the character grabs the entire box
and kicks and beats the children away while he chorfs down.
Anyhow, I'm going to assume my cereal-eating id is correct here 
and give this an <B>A-</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cocoa & Fruity Pebbles</SPAN><BR>
This cereal has problems. First off, it's about the only cereal
that doesn't stay crunchy in milk. It gets soggy in milk, and does
so in a hurry. I've learned, over the years, to severely limit 
the amount of milk I add to Pebbles, lest I be
forced to eat what would be more accurately called "Flaccid
Rice Ovals." Secondly, they have the most God-awful commercials
imaginable. I get enough of the trend of the week without seeing
Barney in a trend-of-the-week costume. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Marshmallow Blasted Froot Loops</SPAN><BR>
Eat as much sugared cereal as I have and you start to be able to imagine
the taste of the latest day-glo breakfast transgression without even 
breaking the seal. Take, for instance, Marshmallow Blasted Froot Loops. "Blasted" appears in this case to be a synonym for "accompanied," because it's
just Froot Loops with marshmallows. And it tastes, paradigm-shatteringly
enough, like Froot Loops would if you added marshmallows. The whole
"Blasted" thing is just a desperate adjective pasted on a pretty dull
concept. <B>C+</B><P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rice Krispies</SPAN><BR>
Requiring your cereal to converse with you is -- how shall I
put this delicately? -- so tragically pathetic as to make Sally
Struthers look like an Ayn Rand heroine by comparison. But then, it has
elves on the box, so what would you expect? It tries to look like
a kids' cereal, but it's beige and basically unsweetened, so the noise 
gimmick and the elves are the only thing keeping it from getting
shelved next to the eight different cereals with "bran" in the title.
If you're not of age to provide your own breakfast and your parent
or guardian won't get you the sweet stuff, it's not a bad compromise.
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Smacks</SPAN><BR>
Does this <EM>sound</EM> good? If you were a cereal magnate and one
of your creatives came up to you and said "I've got a great idea for
a cereal. It's named after drugs and it's got a frog on the box,"
don't you think you'd put him down to be culled in the next downsizing?
"Smacks" itself is actually a more parentally-acceptable version of
the original name: "Satan Worship Smacks." It got shortened in the
same anti-Satanist trend that changed the labels of "Satan Crisp"
and "Satan Frosted Flakes." Silly, really. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Strawberry Shortcake Cereal</SPAN><BR>
This is a defunct cereal, dead as the line of deformed, ill-smelling
dolls that inspired it. And I'm mature enough to be able to
admit that I loved it. Hey, <EM>bite me</EM>. It could have
been called "Advanced Leprosy Puffs" and I still would have loved it,
because strawberry-flavored cereal is a fine idea and it's a pity you
can't get it today. Can you blame me because I was able to see past
the cloying, over-merchandised evil on the box and appreciate the cereal
within? Yeah, your mom. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Oops! All Berries</SPAN><BR>
I guess it's supposed to be charming to pretend that this
cereal was invented by accident, like potato chips, penicillin,
and the Church of Latter-Day Saints, but frankly the lack of 
quality control over on Crunchberry Island is a little disquieting.
Who's to say that the next box won't be labelled "Gosh Darn It! Discarded
Turkey Parts"? Commercial fantasias aside, though, they're pretty darn
yummy. In the long run, you really need the Cap'n Crunch to balance
your ch'i, but as an occasional distraction it's pretty good. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Boo-Berry</SPAN><BR>
Thanks to faithful reader Lish Daelnar, I finally got
my trembling hands on some Boo-Berry for the first time
in my adult life. The fact that it had "Casper and Wendy
Marshmallows" barely detracted from the sinus-clearing
joy of acquisition. It's hard to be objective through
the haze of nostalgia, but this is damn fine cereal. You
have to admire a cereal with the spheres to stick with
one fruit flavor during the modern flavor expansion. No
wildberry, no watermelon, just something vaguely 
resembling blueberry flavor. With marshmallows. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mini Wheats Frosted Original</SPAN><BR>
Weirdly arranged name aside, Mini Wheats Frosted Original
ne&eacute; Frosted Mini-Wheats are the ultimate in 
mixed breakfast metaphors. Shredded Wheat pads
are basically hay bales, and frosting, original or no, can't change that.
Whether you're downing Frosted Mini-Hay Bales, Bite-Sized Hay Bales, or
even if they made Marshmallow Blasted Hay Bales, you can't escape the fact
that you're enjoying the great taste of hay bales.  <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Raisin Bran</SPAN><BR>
A deceptive cereal. First, there's the question of two scoops
of raisins, and what that means.
Last time I checked, the American National Standards Institute
hasn't issued a definitive statement on the volume of a
"scoop." Doubtless one could pick up a miniature scoop with
a capacity of one raisin, so assuming these are whole
raisins, all they're guaranteeing is that there are no fewer
than two raisins in each box.
Secondly, this comes across as a healthful cereal, when in fact those
all-natural sun-poked juicy raisins are so coated in white
sugar that they look like larval pods from "Aliens: A Christmas
Story." I once tried an all-natural raisin bran cereal, and
it was pretty good once I poured a bunch of sugar on it. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Corn Pops</SPAN><BR>
They started referring to it as simply "Pops" in the
commerical. Presumably
"sugar" sounds too unhealthy and "corn" sounds too healthy, so
that all cereals from now on must be abstract allusions to
the fun you'll inevitably have completely ignoring the
suggestion that you serve them with milk, juice and toast.
All right, fine then. Negative: they have the texture of
packing material. Positive: Ever since childhood, packing
material has always looked to me like something you should
pour milk on and eat anyway. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Smurfberry Crunch</SPAN><BR>
This was one of the best of cereals that are now dead, gone,
and pushing up boxtops. I was not a huge fan of the Smurfs.
Heck, I'd give the Snorks two-to-one odds against them in
a fair fight. But this was good cereal, made up of blue
artifical-tasting units and red artifical-tasting units, both
of which tasted exactly the same. The disturbing bit, though
is that this cereal was created by Ralston-Purina, and the
cereal bits were the same size and shape as Little Friskies.
Weird. And, I might add, eerie. <B>A</B></P>

Let's say you're an executive in charge of product development at some
breakfast cereal company, and your latest creation features a rabbit on
the box. Wouldn't you want to inform your project team to take extra care
that the cereal itself does NOT look like rabbit droppings? This little
piece of advice was apparently ignored by the minds behind Nesquik,
because I found myself staring at the smiling Quik Bunny, and a bowl of
tiny chocolate puffs that suddenly seemed incredibly unappetizing. I tried
them anyway, in the name of comedy, and they were pretty good, but still.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Waffle Crisp</SPAN><BR>
By the year 2007, experts predict that every breakfast food will have
been made into a breakfast cereal. Sure, so far they've stuck with  the
sweeter foods like waffles and cinnamon toast, but soon they'll run out of
those and be forced to make Home Fries Crunch and Soft-Boiled Eggies. For
the time being, though, this is pretty good for something maple flavored. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Life</SPAN><BR>
That's a pretty pretentious name. How about "Wisdom Cereal" or
"Existence Puffs"?  At least it provides cheap comedy when you pretend
to get Life Cereal, Life Magazine, Life the  Game, and actual life mixed
up. ("We're going to eat a board game for breakfast?") Anyhow. Mikey. You
can't mention Life without mentioning Mikey. The kid was an eerie

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Kix</SPAN><BR>
Once I was looking at a box of Kix in the cereal aisle of my local
grocery-providing institution, and I read the following explanation
for the mildly sweet flavor of Kix: "We take the sweetness from
inside the corn kernel and put it on the outside!" I thought this
was pretty clever and pointed out to my shopping companion, who
fixed me with a long-suffering stare and said "corn syrup." Sad.
Kix is pretty good, though, if for some reason you want to eat
a cereal that doesn't turn the milk anything in particular. <B>B-</B></P>

It's pretty disturbing the amount of trouble you invite when

other words that made this country great! Okay, political satire,
that was fun. Now, then. Alpha-Bits isn't all that different from

with Frosted Cheerios is "OOOOOOOO." <B>B</B></P>

I'm not clear on the reason behind the misspelling of "vitamin." It's not whimsical, it's just odd. The same, however, could be said for the cereal, which tastes kind of like low-grade Cap'n Crunch, as if Cap'n Crunch had retired from the Cereal Navy and left operations to Lieutenant Junior Grade Crunch, who decided to reduce overhead by cutting the stuff with Corn Chex. I'd suggest getting this only if you're still dependent on your junkfood-hating parents for your breakfast needs and the "Vitaman" convinces them it's healthy, or if you're really into royalty. <B>D</B></P></TD>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Rook</SPAN><BR>
This piece may be the main reason more people don't get into
chess.  They look at this piece, which appears to be a castle to even
the most casual observer, and are told that it's called a Rook.  Then,
just when they're getting used to the whole Rook thing, they're told
that under certain circumstances the piece can "castle."  This is when
they decide that chess was invented by hateful maniacs and give up.
If all English-speaking countries got together and agreed to call the
thing a castle, chess would probably be more popular in the US 
than corn dogs and rap music combined. <B>C-</B></P>
 
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Queen</SPAN><BR>
As far as powerful female figures in popular games go,
the Queen can pretty much kick Lara Croft's ass.  Sure, Lara has big
guns and tight shorts, but can she move both as a Rook and a bishop?
It takes more than pistols to keep a pawn from reaching the eighth rank. <B>A</B></P>
 
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Bishop</SPAN><BR>
Why is a bishop on the battlefield? (Leaving aside the fact
that "Bishop on the Battlefield" is my favorite Randy Newman album.) I'm
sure many chess fans will write in and explain that the Bishop used to
be called the Howitzer or something, but that's not the point. The point
is that it's difficult enough to accept moving towers and Uber-queens
("Moving Towers and Uber-Queens" being my favorite Cat Stevens album)
without dealing with the presence of clergy in battle. They may as well
replace the Knight with the "Reference Librarian." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Knight</SPAN><BR>
The Knight can jump other pieces. This is very welcome to those
of us who, having played checkers much earlier than chess, feel that all
pieces should be able to jump each other. Plus they move in this tricky
"L" shape, which is kind of neat. And they have horse heads. It's hard
to find guys with horse heads who jump a lot and move erratically outside
of the chess board or Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Pawn</SPAN><BR>
I wonder if pawns just realize that they're just pawns in
someone's game. And are they okay with that? Having accepted that they're
pawns, can they at least be glad that they get to attack once in a while,
unlike, say, the little pegs in Cribbage? They look like such simple
little guys, but they're subject to some of the most screwed rules in
the game. I'm sure that many people who managed to get past the whole
Rook/castle thing just threw up their hands when confronted with the
"en passant" rule. If you don't know, you don't want to know. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The King</SPAN><BR>
"The King is a drunk," it was once explained to me. Seeing
as this was after the death of Elvis, I assume they were talking about
chess. It makes sense: the King is just an addlepate figurehead, flanked
by a more competent woman and surrounded by underlings who sacrifice
themselves to preserve his worthless reign. Those with a penchant for
political simile can choose Reagan or Clinton as pleases them. <B>D</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Colorful Ball</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Most people would probably see the delicacy of the Generic Colorful Ornament Ball as a drawback, but for me it has become a source of nostalgia. For whatever reason, I remember childhood Christmases mostly for their clutter: tinsel strips, opened envelopes, empty cans of stewed pumpkin, and tiny shards of shattered Generic Colorful Ornament. Plus, they allow any jerk with a copy of Microsoft Paint to make a Christmas tree drawing. Green triangle, yellow star, buncha multicolored circles. Or just red circles, if you're really lazy. <span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Tinsel</p>
<p class="ratingbody">It was a decade or so before I realized that tinsel was supposed to evoke icicles. I still don't really see it, honestly, but I understand it at least. You'd think that people who are surrounded by actual lung-searing cold wouldn't want to make their houses appear colder than they actually were. But I'm in California, so the imitation ice is just quaint. If we really wanted to re-create winter we'd hang slightly thicker socks from the tree, paint the ceiling kind of a harsh blue, and deck the halls with posters for movies that feature thirty-six scenes with explosions and one scene with a mall Santa. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Trademarked</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Winnie-The-Pooh in a Santa Hat I can see. A little scale model Enterprise I can sort of see, if only due to the geek need to hang scale-model Enterprises from everything. But are people really intent on hanging Assembly Line Lucy Ricardo from their yuletide boughs? It doesn't fit the Christmas principle, it doesn't fit the generic dangly thing principle, it's just a scene from a sitcom with a hook on it. I don't get you people. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Candles</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Clearly, one sign of the increased wimpiness of our society is that we no longer use actual candles on our Christmas trees. The same cultural nannies who have banned those slightly-serrated butterknives from eighteen states, and who successfully campaigned to have street curbs in Cincinnati covered in ankle-protecting velour, have now convinced us that precariously attaching live flame to a dead, resin-exuding tree is somehow dangerous. The fact is, I don't know anyone who has died in a tree-candle fire. I don't even know anyone who suffered burns to more than about a third of their body. Mark my words, if this keeps up we'll soon see prominently marked fire exits in all public buildings. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Construction Paper Rings</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These, I'm certain, are only popular because they contribute to the self-esteem of kindergarteners. You don't see construction paper ring garlands for sale anywhere. They either come from school or some grotty rainy-day crafts book. So you throw them on the tree, then take them down and toss them in the God's Eye/Lanyard/Fingerpainting closet. Meanwhile, those of us without kids use that closet space to store excellent scotch and racy DVDs. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Angel/Star</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Traditionally, you can put a star or an angel on top of the tree. Either one; nobody seems to care. Given the American temperment, I'd expect long Web screeds about anarchist socialists and their heathen star-placing, but people are pretty relaxed. Of course, you can always buy a tree-Buddha if you're feeling like a smartass. Me, I'm thinking a little King Kong would be whimsical. Or a tiny platform with a little member of Earth First and some eensy rice cakes. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Santa Claus is Coming to Town</SPAN><BR>
Also known as "The Extortion Song." Pretty pointless, because
asking kids not to pout is like asking free cyanide ions not to
react with methemoglobin to form cyanohemoglobin. Here's a hint,
kids: Santa is a wuss. Have you ever actually known a kid who 
got coal in his stocking? Last year even that kid who hit you
with the Wiffle bat got a cool RC racer. How do you think <em>he</em>
ended up on the "nice" list? Santa brings toys pretty much unilaterally,
and all the pouting, shouting and crying in the world won't change that.
<B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Silent Night</SPAN><BR>
The thing I like about this song is that if you learned it
you probably first learned it without really understanding it. 
Nobody ever sits you down and says "Okay. Here's what 'tender and mild' 
means outside of a bowl of chile verde." So you're going along,
singing this year after year of your youth, "Roun dyon ver gin, tin
der an miiiild" and then one day it hits you. These are words!
There's a story here! A very touching story about a round virgin
who wants to go to sleep! Kiddie catharsis. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Twelve Days of Christmas</SPAN><BR>
Also known as "99 Bottles of Yuletide Beer on the Wall." This song
is pure torture. It's a torture to sing, it's a torture to listen to,
it's a torture to try and figure out in what context "Lords a-Leaping"
are a traditional Christmas gift. My least favorite part is "Five Golden
Rings," because by the time you're dealing with the Pipers Piping, everyone's
so bored they try and invest the song with a little liveliness by
singing the Golden Rings part like a soloing tenor, which just degrades
the already degrading experience for everyone. If we must sing this song,
I suggest we toss everything from the Swans A-Swimming onward, call it
the Six Days of Christmas, and get back to drinking. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Santa Baby</SPAN><BR>
Oh, please.
<B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jingle Bells</SPAN><BR>
People generally only sing the first verse of this, the
one with the bells on bob-tail, and the chorus. This is a 
pity, as the song has three more verses which deal mostly 
with falling out of the sleigh and into the snow, with a
few sly references to girls. With the additional verses,
the song is transformed from
a dopey cheer for a form of transportation that doesn't 
get much use outside of Norway into a sort of Dickensian
Cannonball Run. We lose so many of the subtleties in this
culture. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Heat Miser Song</SPAN><BR>
This is, without question, the best song to come out of
the various animated Christmas specials. Better than 
"Holly Jolly Christmas," better than the one where the
elf wants to be a dentist, even better than that weird-ass
song the Whos sang in "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas."
For those of you who need the refresher, the Heat Miser was
this guy who had a brother, the Cold Miser, and they each sang
in kind of a rinky-tink showtune way about how hot and cold
they were, respectively. It was raucous. Beats hell out
of figgy pudding any day of the week. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Colonel Mustard</SPAN><BR>
A man among men. A hearty adventurer who grabs life with both hands
and stuffs it into his mouth like so much canned chili, making chorfing
sounds all the while. A ladies' man, a gentleman's gentleman, and a
closet cross-dresser, Colonel Mustard, bastard half-brother of the
Beatles' Mean Mister Mustard, could probably kill Mr. Boddy, grind him up
and serve him to the jurors in their city-hall-cafeteria enchiladas, and
still get off scott-free. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mrs. Peacock</SPAN><BR>
Peacock is a color? And it's light blue? I've seen peacocks --
abrasive, parasite-ridden birds with a cry like a drowning drunk crow --
and as far as I've been able to tell, light blue is not part of their
admittedly impressive display. It's hard for me to imagine that a
valium-addled society matron like Mrs. Peacock would be able to crack
someone's skull in a single deft blow of an eight-pound candlestick, but
if there's a way we can frame actual peacocks for this crime, I'm all
for it. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Miss Scarlet</SPAN><BR>
A cunning seductress with a smile like the clink of a poisoned
wine glass and a heart of cold, hard cash. Even if Miss Scarlet
didn't do it, she probably would have gotten around to it sooner
or later; if there's one thing made clear from the game, it's that
Boddy was loaded, and what Scarlet wants, Scarlet gets.
Three pieces of advice: don't trust her, don't turn your 
back on her, and don't ask her to hold your lead pipe for you while 
you take a nap in the conservatory. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mr. Green</SPAN><BR>
Mr. Green didn't do it. Do you know why? He didn't have the
<EM>conejos!</EM> (Spanish for "rabbits." And I stand by that.)
Mr. Green is a cigar-chomping, balding beef-jerky broker from
Urbana, Illinois -- it's obvious he doesn't know from murder. I could see
him kicking a potted plant in a blind fit of pure glandular rage, but
that's about it. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mrs. White</SPAN><BR>
Mrs. White, having waited on Mr. Boddy hand, foot, and teakettle for untold
years without complaint, is a prime candidate to have snapped like an
autumn twig and offed him with any of the weapons that were lying around
or, in a pinch, stabbed him in the back with one of the little red
pegs from "Battleship." Personally, I think "Clue II: The Wrath of 
Mrs. White" would make for great educational board-game fun for the
whole family. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Professor Plum</SPAN><BR>
A professor, yes, but what sort of professor? A detached academician
in the tradition of "The Professor" from Gilligan's Island? An evil
genius, intellectual heir to Professor Moriarty? I actually see him
as more in the vein of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew from the old Muppet Show;
roundish, bumbling, and made of chartreuse felt. Man, I have to stop
getting loaded on Buttershots before writing these things... <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Martini</SPAN><BR>
Ah, the drink of choice for the pseudo-sophisticate who
considered Jell-O shots the height of glamour until "Swingers"
came out. You can tell the <EM>real</EM> losers because they
specify whether they want their Martini shaken or stirred, but
they don't bother to ask for name gin. Whatever difference
shaking supposedly makes, it's not going to hide the fact that
well gin is the most god-awful substance ever to sterilize a
cigarette burn. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Harvey Wallbanger</SPAN><BR>
With most oddly-named drinks ("Long Slow Comfortable Screw in a
Rusty Black Cadillac, Jos&eacute;") the name is, shall we say, the
best part. Not Harvey, though. A well-made Harvey Wallbanger is
like a Wampa: strong, cold, and quite capable of knocking you
unconscious. I wouldn't recommend the Galliano on its own, though.
By itself it's a disconcerting bright yellow, and it smells like
licorice jelly beans.  But combined with vodka and
fresh orange juice, it becomes something truly remarkable. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cuba Libre</SPAN><BR>
A good choice for those who find all this froufing about with
shakers and sword-shaped toothpicks to be distasteful,
and who long for the days when strawberry-kiwi wine coolers were
considered a sophisticated beverage selection. What is it? It's a
rum and Coke. With lime juice. But it <EM>sounds</EM> good. Pronounce
it KOO-bah LEE-bray and you'll fit right in with your painfully
retro palsie-walsies. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tequila Shooters</SPAN><BR>
The whole shooter craze never did much for me, but a tequila shot
done in the classic style -- salt, tequila, lime, involuntary neck spasm --
is more than a shooter. It's a brief drama, a tragic opera of spirits
that fits in the palm of your hand. Pain and passion, sweetness and tears, citrus and
sodium and fermented cactus juice. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bloody Mary</SPAN><BR>
Delicious when well-prepared. And according to federal school lunch guidelines 
it qualifies as a vegetable. One incredibly important note: a Bloody Mary does
<EM>not</EM> contain V-8. I don't know what kind of blasphemous watercress-infested
stew you get by combining V-8 and vodka, but a Bloody mary it isn't. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mimosa</SPAN><BR>
Mmm...<EM>breakfast</EM> booze. It's wonderful how Western culture has produced
such a transparent, yet socially acceptable method of getting a buzz before noon
on Mother's Day. Champagne drinks tend to be a little affected for
my tastes, but any port in a storm. As it were. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Espresso</SPAN><BR>
Espresso has always struck me as the intellectual's equivalent of movie
cowboys ordering rye whiskey in a dirty shot glass. It has the same
connotation of ritualistic self-abuse in a community setting, only with
more elaborate preparation. I back this up with the observation that
all the praise I hear for espresso is for its potency rather than
for its flavor. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Con Panna</SPAN><BR>
"Con panna" is Europe-speak for "I'd like Reddi-Whip on that,
please." Once in a <I>luna azzurra</I> you find a shop that makes a dense,
bitter whipped cream which goes well with the espresso, but by and
large you get crappy fluffy whipped cream, leading to a sort of disconcerting
Swiss-Miss-goes-Domme effect. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Iced Mocha</SPAN><BR>
Mochae of any sort are lovely, but iced mocha on a hot day makes me
happy to be alive, in the literal sense that it forcibly alters my brain
chemistry. I've had them artistically choreographed into existence,
and I've had them slapped together mechanistically, but like pizza and
movies with "bikini" in the title, even when they're bad they're good.
<B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Americano</SPAN><BR>
Possibly the greatest slur against American culture since -- well,
all the other really memorable slurs against American culture have come from
Americans, so it's hard to compare. In an apparent retaliatory strike
against General Foods "International" Coffees, continentals have decided
to water down their espresso and blame us. Suffice to say the failings
of espresso are emphasized and the admirable qualities minimized in this
malconceived concoction. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chai</SPAN><BR>
One of the great things about the West Coast is that we appropriate the
food of other cultures first. Californians were enjoying pesto and sushi
while Midwesterners were still getting used to the concept of salad
bars. Chai, spicy East Indian tea mixed with milk, was until recently
very difficult to track down even around here, but it has since become a
staple of the caffeine-inhaling scene. This is all very self-aggrandizing,
I know, but I have to make myself feel better about the fact that most
restaurants around here wouldn't know a rare steak if it bled on  them. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pennies</SPAN><BR>
There's just no point in having these in circulation. 
It started with the penny trays. Even
the sort of convenience stores that wouldn't let you get
away with taking an extra spoon-straw have those 
give-a-penny-take-a-penny trays. And recently, I've noticed,
an increasing number of stores just round your change up anyway.
Not Safeway or the other big ones, but corner stores. Buy
something for $2.03, give 'em a fiver, and you get three bucks back.
This isn't altruism, folks. If pennies had any real value, I'm sure 
these same stores would be hoarding them with grinchlike
intensity, but they don't. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Nickels</SPAN><BR>
One little bit of trivia I kept coming across in my
school days was that nickels no longer contained any nickel.
This didn't exactly shatter my world-view; it took an
in-depth discussion of "creme filling" to do that. Nickels could
be made of manganese and depleted uranium for all I cared;
I just knew that seven of them could buy me a Richie Rich
comic. However, now I find myself lying awake at night wondering
which is worth more, a plugged nickel or a wooden nickel? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dimes</SPAN><BR>
Far more interesting to my school-age mind than the nickel
thing was the eternal mystery of the size of a dime. They're
<EM>smaller</EM> than nickels and pennies, but they're
<EM>worth more</EM>! Whoa! Heavy! What I like is that a dime can
curl up comfortably just within the ridges of a penny. It's
kind of sweet. And also, the way that sometimes just one half of
the edge of a dime will wear off and show some copper, leading
to this attractive two-tone look. They're interesting coins. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Quarters</SPAN><BR>
Now, this is a coin. I love the heft of a quarter. It's so
authoritative. You can flip it, roll it, you can slide it
smoothly into the coin slot of a Tempest video game and you're
<EM>playing</EM> that mother. And now that they're going to have
little symbols of the various states on the back, it'll be
like having little U-Haul trucks in your pocket. Neat. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dollar Coins</SPAN><BR>
I still get Susan B. Anthony dollars out of the change machine
at the post office, and I don't know what happens to them. I
have less against Susie B's than many people do, but I just can't 
endorse dollars that are presumably sneaking out with the quarters.
So now they're putting the finishing touches on a new fem-embossed
dollar coin, and they're talking about little subtle things they
can do to make them less quatrine. Why not just put a big hole in the
middle? Or make them triangular? Or both? These must be the same
traditionalists who refuse to abandon pennies. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Drink Coca-Cola (1886)</SPAN><BR>
This was the original slogan. I understand advertising was much
less reliant on mountain bikes and above-the-navel tube tops 
in the 1800's than it is now. This is the quintessential Coca-Cola slogan;
it's short, it's vaguely authoritarian, and it completely fails to
actually give any reasons <EM>why</EM> you should drink Coke. This
is because you can't actually convince anyone they need Coke. You
either like the taste or you don't, and it doesn't provide you with
any benefits you can't get from other places, like hummingbird
feeders. Their ad campaigns are instead based on making sure that
everyone who would ever consider drinking Coke never forgets for
an instant that the option is available. Anyhow, this at least is
simple and to the point. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke (1971)</SPAN><BR>
This was an offshoot of the unfortunate ad jingle turned
folk song I was forced to sing too many times in grade
school. The song was, among other things, about teaching
the world to sing in perfect harmony, which is pretty ironic
because most of the people I've heard sing it were in no
position to be giving lessons. Don't get me wrong,
I'm all in favor of starry-eyed idealism, but not when it's
being used to sell soda pop, and especially not when it contains
forced lines about snow-white turtledoves. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coke Adds Life (1976)</SPAN><BR>
They missed out on a great chance for an ad here. Scene: the
Garden of Eden, circa 4004 BC. God (looking not unlike the
Coke-swilling Santa Claus of yore) forms Adam from the dust,
humming mildly to himself as he does so. When Adam's prone and
lifeless form is complete, God dribbles a couple drops of
Coca-Cola onto his lips. Adam blinks, sits up, and sees the
Big Guy holding an icy-cold bottle of Coke. Being only recently
made of dust, he's parched, and reaches out to God in
a pose strongly reminiscent of the Sistine Chapel. "Coca-Cola Adds Life."
Boom, instant megahit. They could have followed up with a series
of Old Testament Coke ads, and eventually released The Bible,
Revised Caffeinated Edition. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coke Is It (1982)</SPAN><BR>
At this point they've gone from authoritarian to positively Orwellian.
"Coke Is All There Is," the slogan seems to imply. "All Is Coke.
There Are No Other Forms of Refreshment. Drink Coke Or Die Screaming."
Armed, jackbooted Cola Enforcers roam the streets, dragging off anyone
caught with a can of Mountain Dew. Children in school pledge allegiance to
Coke. History books mentioning Pepsi are burned in secret. Red flags
with jaunty white ribbons running across them snap sternly in the
hot wind. "Coke. Do Not Attempt To Escape." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Red, White and You (1986)</SPAN><BR>
This was a result of the doomed New Coke fiasco. The Coca-Cola
company, whipped into shame by people who never protested when
their ketchup or paper towels were "improved," re-releases
"Coca-Cola Classic" with this lame slogan. The ominous pronouncements
of past campaigns are replaced with a wheedling humanist attempt to 
get people to identify themselves with Coca-Cola. Before, Coke was above
mere humans; it was a force of history, a societal universal.
Now it's a touchy-feely hands-on Soft Drink of the People. "Coke
Feels Your Pain." <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Always Coca-Cola (1993)</SPAN><BR>
Now we're getting back into the familiar realms of overstatement.
Coke already trades on nostalgia to an alarming extent, especially
come Christmastide. This slogan, I think, is an attempt to pioneer
the powerful advertising concept of "pre-nostalgia." Teen cola drinkers
are too young to have misty memories of days gone by, but Coca-Cola
assures them that one day they'll miss their days of looking forward
to the time when they can look back fondly on their youthful
exuberance for their nostalgic future. And Coca-Cola will have
been there. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lozenges</SPAN><BR>
I enjoy the lozenge. I consider lozenge-sucking one of the few good
aspects of a sinus-swelling throat infection. I suck them down like
considerably less-jolly Jolly Ranchers. I made the mistake of looking
at the ingredient list once, though. It said "ACTIVE INGREDIENT: PECTIN."
Pectin? How is pectin an active ingredient in the war against throat
pain? I think they just put that in there because "ACTIVE INGREDIENT:
YOUR OWN SALIVA, ACTUALLY" isn't going to sell a lot of cough drops. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chicken Soup</SPAN><BR>
Every flu season magazines and newspapers love to run articles about
how chicken soup really is good for a cold, <EM>just like they say.</EM>
One doctor says that cooked chicken releases anti-respiratory medication,
another says that soup inhibits inflammatory white blood cells, and
so forth. That's all fine and good, but if someone tries to present
me with scientific proof that <CITE>Chicken Soup for the Soul</CITE>
actually <EM>is</EM> good for your soul, I'm leaving the planet. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Vicks Vapo-Rub</SPAN><BR>
I remember this being very soothing as a child, but I've never been able
to actually work up the will to spread menthol goo on my own chest as
an adult. Lying on my back with globs of jelly in my chest hair would
just make me feel like somebody's fetish. Plus, and this is the kicker,
it makes me smell like some sort of monstrous irradiated eucalyptus
tree. None for me, thanks. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cough Syrup</SPAN><BR>
You'll note that the ultimate low point for booze is tasting like cough
syrup.  If the alcohol in question is coming out of a shatter-proof
plastic jug, chances are someone will point out the similarity to it and
Robitussin. Given that I'm not the biggest fan of cheap booze, the
ideal abstraction of cheap booze isn't going to appeal to me either,
cough or no cough. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Echinacea</SPAN><BR>
Blech blech blech. Talk about the cure being worse than the disease.
If I were to catch an illness that made the taste of echinacea
ooze down my throat every thirty minutes, I'd be pounding on the
triage counter at the emergency room demanding satisfaction faster than
you can say "FDA approval." Luckily Big Medicine is catching on to this 
and releasing items with the echinacea flavor heavily masked. If they
come out with children's chewable echinacea I might give it a try. <B>D</B></P>

Seriously. Before you ever pull out a binder to show someone what's in it, ask
yourself, "Have I performed oral sex on this person in the last week? Do I want the opportunity to do so ever again?" Only if the answer to the first is "yes" and the second is "no" should you risk opening that binder.

plates? Thirdly, they send off ultrasonic signals to cats saying "break meeeee...I turn into field mice when fraaaactured..."

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Orion</SPAN><BR>
A premier constellation. Easy to find -- at least in the
Northern Hemisphere in winter --
actually looks vaguely like what it's supposed to look like, 
and doesn't have all the cultural baggage associated 
with the various Zodiac signs. He has a dog and a club and
no visible head. What could be more manly than that? <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Ursas</SPAN><BR>
First off, I think we've got a name problem here. "Ursa Minor"
and "Ursa Major" sound like silent film stars of Ukrainian
heritage, and "The Big Bear and the Little Bear" sounds like a heartwarming
Disney feature. I suggest we change it to "Ursa Awesome"
and "Ursa Funky." Anyhow, The Flying Ursas are better known as
"The Big and Little Dippers Plus Some Other Stars." (They're
known as "The Ploughs" in the UK, but that's just because the
Brits love words with letters you don't pronounce.) Everyone
digs on the Dippers, because everyone can find them. Who am I 
to argue? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pegasus</SPAN><BR>
Pegasus, the powerful winged horse of legend, is represented
in the night sky by a lopsided boxy shape. It kind of makes you lose
your faith in the stories where the gods reward the noble and heroic by
putting their images into the heavens. It sounds more to me
like the gods had a few stars they didn't know what to do with, and
a flying horse they figured deserved some sort of recognition, and 
so they kludged it. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bootes</SPAN><BR>
Yet another hunter, not nearly as cool as Orion. The main
reason I even mention him is to bring attention to the fact
that Bootes was proud owner of the "Silliest Name for a Celestial
Body" award, right up until they discovered the Oort Cloud in 1950. Word
has it that Booteans are still steamed over that one, and there's 
a growing movement to change the constellation's name to 
"Bunsy-Wunsy Monchichi" in hopes of winning it back. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Southern Cross</SPAN><BR>
Pragmatism in action; it's southern, it's a cross, why
bother trying to convince people it's actually the picture
of a huge celestial bison or something? Of course, if we
applied this to the entire sky, we'd end up with constellations
like "The Great Big Glob of Stars," "The Not Quite So Big Glob of
Stars" and "That Star Glob Next To That Other Star Glob." But
as an exception, the candor is refreshing. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Norma</SPAN><BR>
Yes, there's a constellation named Norma. I didn't even know this
until I did some fact-checking in an effort to keep readers from
writing me to say things like "For your information,
there is no such thing as 'Pelvis Minor.'" The back-story here is
that a French guy named Nicolas Louis de Lacaille noticed that
the Southern Hemisphere was severely lacking in constellation names.
Unfortunately, Nicolas wasn't the most visionary guy in the world,
and rather than giving the his new constellations 
properly cool names like "Borgo, Mighty God of Cheese," he named
most of them after devices like "The Clock" and
"The Air Pump," thus turning the night sky over Australia into
a scientific equipment catalog. "Norma," then, means "The Level."
Pretty lame. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Glass Bottles</SPAN><BR>
We're running out of things to break. Some day we're going to
see a movie featuring an alcoholic who decides to give up drinking
when he realizes that people need him, and he's going to throw away 
his fifth of cheap gin in disgust and it's going to BOUNCE. In
the meantime, I'm grateful that we still have glass bottles to shatter
against the wall, to knock out unruly cowboys, and for Mr. Miyagi to
cut in half with one sweep of his hand. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gift Baskets</SPAN><BR>
In shopping for gifts this Creditmas, at first I was going to
arrange my treasures in small attractive baskets before sending them out,
on the vague principle that people have some sort of use for small
baskets. Then I realized that they don't. People generally have
all the small containers for holding jewelry/condoms/change/drugs
they need, and gift baskets are just going to be thrown in the closet
with all the other packaging you feel obliged to re-use. So it's
back to the Sunday comics for me. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cans</SPAN><BR>
I like cans. I like that you need a special tool to open them,
I like that it's easy to make them unidentifiable by ripping the
labels off. I like that you can buy dented ones cheap if you
have a taste for danger and Dinty Moore. I like that they stack.
I like that they come in revoltingly massive sizes for restaurant
and cafeteria use. I like the feeling you get when you have cans in
your cupboard that you're somehow ready to survive a hurricane
or terrorist attack, even if you only have six and they're all pears
in syrup. Cans are neat. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shoeboxes</SPAN><BR>
I remember learning in grade school about the Golden Mean, which
is supposedly the porportions that most appeals to the human mind, or
at least the dead Greek human mind. Anyhow, I think the same
thing applies to shoeboxes. There's something about the size and
shape of a shoebox that shouts "Store things in me!" in echoing tones.
Sometimes I have to go find some nice rocks or safety pins just
to obey the Will of the Shoebox. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Paper Grocery Bags</SPAN><BR>
Paper or plastic? Paper! Paper is better for so many reasons it would take
three trips just to get them out of the trunk. Try and make an amusing
robot mask out of a plastic bag! You can't!  It doesn't work and you're
likely to end up dead with a wad of plastic in your lungs. Cats don't
climb curiously into plastic bags and then sit there with their tails
hanging out. You can't scribble a phone number or draw a picture
of a pony princess on a plastic bag. It's all about arts
and crafts, baby. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Circus Cookies</SPAN><BR>
Mmmmm! Unidentifiable animal lumps! Vaguely organism-shaped,
frosting-swathed, pink-and-white cookie gobs! With sprinkles!
Circus Cookies are just another example of the leaps of faith
one is expected to make as a child. Vegetables are good for you, 
running around in the rain in your underwear is bad for you, and 
circus cookies are shaped like animals, dammit. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lorna Doone Shortbread Cookies</SPAN><BR>
One of the great traumas of my childhood was when my mother
decided to pick up shortbread cookies.
It was not unlike when she tried to convince us that
fresh fruit qualified as dessert; for the life of me, I couldn't figure out
what she was thinking. Didn't the package say "bread" right on it?
Weren't they completely devoid of frosting, filling, or jolly artificial
colors? Were they not hawked by someone named "Lorna"?
It was amazing to me that they ever got past the cookie
division of the FDA. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Oreos</SPAN><BR>
Not so much the king of cookies as the evil overlord. And I mean
that in a good way. Oreos have elevated cookiedom to an act of
terrorism; when I don't have them I want them the way a lab monkey
wants heroin. When I do have them I want more. They're showing
signs of overlord-style hubris, though. With the mini Oreos and
the fudge Oreos and the Oreos with odd shapes on them and the 
strangely colored holiday Oreos and the eerie white-fudge-covered
ermine-esque Oreos, maybe the brand name will soon stretch itself
so thin that I can escape. In the meantime, they beat
hell out of Hydrox.<B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Nilla Wafers</SPAN><BR>
Considering Nilla Wafers, Froot Loops, and Kool-Aid, it's a wonder
kids ever learn to spell or sit still. As cookies, these pups
rate only slightly higher than Shortbread, q.v. However, they
are the philosopher's stone of instant pudding, transforming
vanilla pudding into gold. Well, along with bananas. Of all the
Arkie cuisine passed down from my grandmother to my mother to
me, Vanilla Pudding with Nilla Wafers and Bananas is the
proverbial cake-taker. Of course, in the big picture the whole
carrots in Jell-O thing kind of offsets that. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fig Newtons</SPAN><BR>
These are weird. Nabisco launched an ad campaign trying to
convince us that Newtons are not cookies, but rather are
an entity unto themselves, too worthy to be sunk into common
snack food genera. So if you heard a hearty "yeah, right" echo
through the collective unconscious recently, that's why.
I don't know about you, but in my local grocery they're
located right between the E.L. Fudge and the Flaky Flix.
If that's not the very definition of a cookie, I don't know
what is. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chocolate Nutter Butters</SPAN><BR>
You know, I'm not actually a big fan of peanutiness, and less
so of things that are shaped like peanuts but are not actually
peanuts. Having said that, I'm forced to admit to a near-fanatical
allegiance to Nutter Butters. I don't get it. Anyhow, I suffered
a brief cardiac caesura when I discovered the existence of
Chocolate Nutter Butters, which are the same deal only with
chocolate cookies. And also, they suck. I don't know how
they did it, but they managed to find chocolate cookies that
make the ones in the big Mother's assortment bag taste like
ambrosia by comparison. Bleagh. <B>D-</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Denial</p>
<p class="ratingbody">It's a shame you can't ride this one out right up to the end. When
I'm lying in bed at night and I'm suddenly clenched in the grip
of the terrible knowledge of my own inevitable mortality, my
usual coping mechanism is to assume I'm going to get hit by a bus.
Assuming the bus driver is competent enough to kill me instantly,
that relieves me of any need to acknowledge the possibility that
I might not live to see Alpha Centauri colonized or leg warmers
come back into fashion. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Anger</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Perfectly understandable for the corpse-in-training, but this
has got to be a big pain for various loved ones, caretakers,
and pharmacists. Not only is the sickie in question acting
like a big jerk, propriety keeps those in attendance from
saying "Look. Do us all a favor. Lay down, shut up, and metastasize."</p>

<p class="ratingbody">"Do not go gently into that good night" sounds
all well and good when you're popping by to get some poetic
inspiration, but I imagine at some point most of the survivors
would like the dying person to at least go, if not gently, then
at least reasonably politely. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Bargaining</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Is this the right word? "Bargaining," to me, implies a sort of
back-and-forth negotation. This stage, instead, involves paying unlicensed
medical practitioners to do a song-and-dance involving chicken blood and
speaking in tongues, and/or desperately performing the sorts of nice, pious
neighborly acts you probably should have been doing all along.</p>

<p class="ratingbody">While I find a certain amount of
inexplicable charm in the idea of God saying "Look, you want this
brain tumor in remission, and I want to give you that. I really
do. But you're going to have to do better than a couple bags of
canned goods," I think the more precise term for this stage is
"Grasping at straws." <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Depression</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Also understandable. Hell, in this day and age any perfectly
healthy person with access to cable television has a right
to be depressed. The knowledge that in a short while you're
going to be pushing up neatly cropped cemetary grass while those you
love get to go on having ice cream and picking out new sweaters
and--worst of all--eventually getting over your death, well
even the thought of it is getting me sort of down.</p>

<p class="ratingbody">Hint to photographers bucking for a Pulitzer:
this is the best stage to get your shots in. The slack jaw
and air of resignation, the concerned, hand-patting family,
the neatly tucked sheets--it's <em>pure gold, baby</em>! <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Acceptance</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad to see that this is the final stage. It would be a bummer
if "Acceptance" was followed by "Regret" or "Karaoke." As it is,
though, your archetypical bucket-kicker gets to spend his or her
last few days or hours or picoseconds appreciating birdsong and
working on a catchy tombstone motto. They still end up equally dead,
though. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<!--#set var="s_title" value="crackers"-->
<!--#set var="keywords" value="ratings" -->

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chicken In A Biskit</SPAN><BR>
My two contradictory questions about this cracker are "Why?" and "Why stop there?" The whole idea of a chicken-flavored cracker is so revolting that I wonder why there's a market for that and not, say, Pork in a Biskit. The more flesh-flavored crackers we create, the closer we get to admitting to ourselves that we are, culturally speaking, batshit insane. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ritz</SPAN><BR>
"Everything," I am told, "tastes better when it's sitting on a Ritz." No exception is made for other Ritzes, so from this statement we can infer that any given stack of Ritz crackers tastes better than any smaller stack of Ritz crackers, and thus the tastiest stack of Ritz crackers is the tallest one that you can fit in your mouth. Anyone testing this hypothesis is encouraged to send me a detailed analysis and photos. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Goldfish Crackers</SPAN><BR>
There's a weird sort of winding logic here. Cheddar is sort of orangey in color, and so are goldfish. People have been known to eat both, although not for the same purpose and probably not at the same sitting. I wouldn't say that goldfish-shaped cheese crackers were <em>inevitable</EM>, but I can see how the concept would be compelling. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Carr's Water Crackers</SPAN><BR>
I always buy these things when I get some sort of nice stinky cheese, because I have some sense that it's appropriate. This is not based on any real appreciation of the art of cracker baking, but rather on the fact that they're British -- and thus cultured, just like the Sex Pistols and Benny Hill -- and that I'd feel silly saying "Here's some nice imported Gruyere I picked up at the farmer's market. Wheat Thin?" Pretension and milkfat go hand-in-hand. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Triscuits</SPAN><BR>
I never thought of this before I sat down and tried to come up with something compelling to say about Triscuits, but the name seems to be some sort of pun. You see, instead of Bi-scuits, they go one more and give you TRI-scuits, providing you with three of whatever a "scuit" is. Having deconstructed this bit of culinary wordplay I can say with confidence: that's really dumb. <B>C-</B>

<P><B>A Video on Foot Fungus</B></BR>
"Fungus-free nails are a bare necessity" claims the pamphlet that comes
with this truly disturbing video, which just shows the level of privilege we've become
accustomed to in this county. You're not likely, for instance, to see "Toenail
Fungus  Ravages Bosnia" splashed across the front page of  your local daily metropolitan newspaper,
but around here it comes under the same category as clean drinking water.
The video goes on at great length about how wonderful it is to finally be able to
display your previously-disgusting toenails in public, but the explicit discussion
of fungus infection is nearly enough to turn me off to the idea of feet in general. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">LEGO Mania Magazine</SPAN><BR>
The first thing that caught my eye on the cover of this catalog-slash-magazine
devoted to LEGO Brand Building Block Toys That You Have To Pry Apart With Your Teeth
is the little samurai LEGO guy saying "Holy-Cow! That flying ninja has our awesome,
cool and hip secret treasure!" It's difficult to imagine what a samurai might be guarding that
would qualify as hip. Judging from the picture, the latest thing capturing the attention
of the nation's cutting-edge trendsetters must be little shiny pieces of plastic that
are supposed to look like coins. Huh. Still, it's LEGO. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bear and Doll Supply Catalog</SPAN><BR>
So I know what all my friends are getting for Christmas. Bear noses! 
Bear noses for all! That or vinyl grandma heads! What could be more
heartwarming than to come downstairs on Christmas morning to
find a hundred bulk bear noses and a couple vinyl grandma heads
waiting for you? Disembodied pixie legs, maybe? Well, they have all
those and much, much more in this wonderful catalog. I have great
and eerie plans for the little boxes that say "ma-ma" when you turn them over. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mail-Order Bride Directory</SPAN><BR>
I don't know what sort of wacky-ass mailing list I'm on. Did someone sign
me up for this, or is the logic something like "This guy has a Web page. Ergo,
he has to import potential mates from former USSR nations."? The cover says
"Great Pricing!" One page features four women named Olga. Olga Alpha likes "art,
musik, nature, travel, cosy home." Olga Beta is looking for "caring person who likes
to spoil lady." Olga Gamma is a student of "radioecology" and wants a "well-build" man.
And Olga Delta is "seeking a loving romantic relationship with someone who values love."
And that's just the tip of the Olga iceberg. This catalog is chock full of Olgas, who
I'm sure are warm and intelligent human beings. But it's still a lot of Olgas. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Garage Door Pamphlet and Stickers</SPAN><BR>
This is a work of marketing genius. They give you this pamphlet advertising
these safety-oriented garage doors -- including a rather vivid demonstration
involving a crushed pretzel as a finger stand-in -- and then, because they <EM>care</EM>,
they provide you with a bunch of stickers to put on and around your present
garage door, stickers which say, in essence, "CAUTION: THIS DOOR WILL KILL
EVERYTHING YOU LOVE." Very nice. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cornflower</SPAN><BR>
This was always kind of an eerie color for me. Maybe I
haven't spent enough time around corn, but this crayon just seems wrong.
It's blue. It's kind of this dusky blue with no corn-like qualities
whatsoever. It's also one of those superfluous colors. There's really
nothing you're going to be coloring to make you say "I need cornflower!"
It's just this sad isolated hue. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gold</SPAN><BR>
Essentially unconvincing. This color was obviously designed to
look good on the stick at the expense of its appearance on paper. In
cylindrical form it looks all shiny and exciting and glinty but on paper
it's just this muddy, vaguely golden smear. What was intended to be
a huge gleaming pot of gold comes out looking like mediocre curry. 
<B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">White</SPAN><BR>
Useless. Invisible on white paper, not at all white on colored
paper, and not as effective for creating light colors as just not pressing
as hard. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a no-nonsense audit into
the Crayola Corporation's books revealed that this non-color is only
included as a method of saving on the cost of wax dye. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Brick Red</SPAN><BR>
A red among reds. A true red's red. Oh, sure, I wouldn't
want to do without plain old "red," but brick red adds that certain
je ne sais whatever to everything from fire engines to Superman's cape.
It says "I see the world in a more shadowy, but perhaps deeper
tone than most." It also says "My brother's using the red." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Burnt Umber</SPAN><BR>
The question on everyone's mind, of course, is "what's an umber,
and why would someone want to burn one?" Well, breaking with the
long-standing Ratings tradition of making stuff up, I actually went
and checked a dictionary. Umber is darker than ocher or sienna, and
it's burnt because that way it's different. No need to thank me,
and send any contributions of gratitude to the charity of your choice. 
<B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Green Yellow</SPAN><BR>
It's hard to believe that the same company that brought us "midnight
blue" and "vivid tangerine" also saddled us with "yellow green" and
"green yellow." I'm thinking interns. At any rate, I've never
been able to remember which the more greeny one is and which is more
yellowy. I mean, okay, maybe "coloring in Dopey's shirt" isn't
high up there on the list of important world issues, but a man
comes to expect a little certainty from his crayons. <B>C-</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dragons</SPAN><BR>
		The problem with dragons is that you only hear about
		when they get killed, thus leaving the impression
		that dragons are huge, fire-breathing, enormously
		destructive creatures that are really quite easy to take down. 
		They need to add more background material to dragon stories,
		along the lines of "Chapter 14: Smaug eats another well-armored
		and well-trained adventurer who never had a Smurf's chance in
		a blender." The other problem is that dragons rank second
		only to vampires in the list of "Mythological creatures that
		people tend to identify a little too closely with." The level
		of denial is adequately illustrated by the following searches
		on AltaVista: "I am a dragon": 157. "I am a sales clerk": 0. 
		<B>C+</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Unicorns</SPAN><BR>
		If you weren't well-acquainted with modern American
		culture, you might be inclined to think that unicorns
		were pretty cool; one-horned uber-horses with a
		thing for virgins, chock full of psycho-sexual
		goodness. The difficulty lies not with unicorns
		themselves, but with airbrush artists. Three decades
		of putting misty renditions of unicorns between
		the sad harlequin posters and the David Cassidy/Scott
		Baio/Hanson posters have made the unicorn only
		slightly more effective a symbol of wild purity
		than Pekkle the Sanrio Duck. <B>D</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Vampires</SPAN><BR>
		I could make a crack about "Vampire: The Masquerade"
		being D&amp;D for people who own "The Downward
		Spiral," but I have a copy of both, so I'll limit
		myself to observing that with the increasing
		popularity of vampires, we're on the verge of the
		unicorn syndrome all over again.  If it hasn't
		happened already, in a few months look for airbrushed
		posters of sad vampires in Wal-Marts everywhere,
		and in a decade look for female college students
		saying to each other "Were you into vampires when
		you were nine? Me too! We were such dorks!" <B>C</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mermaids</SPAN><BR>
		The most incredible power of mermaids, of course,
		is their ability to keep their hair covering their
		nipples at all times. Or, in the case of cartoon
		mermaids, the ability to wear seashells as a bra
		without bitching about the rough edges. At any
		rate, I don't buy the whole "Sailors mistook manatees
		for mermaids" line. Manatees are among the least
		mermaidenly of all mammals. It would be easier to
		mistake Al Gore for a lovely young fish-woman.
		More likely some sailor had a thing for manatees,
		and invented the mermaid-mistake story to keep the
		other sailors from ribbing him about it. <B>C-</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Werewolves</SPAN><BR>
		It's said that ancient legends have lessons for humanity,
		even unto the present day. The most important lesson
		we've learned from the legend of the werewolf is "don't
		cast Jack Nicholson in a role requiring him to run in
		slow motion." Aside from that, though, werewolves are
		pretty cool. You turn into a murderous, slavering wolf
		every full moon. Simple, yet effective, and much better
		than turning into a B-movie-style furry guy with fangs,
		which to me just looks like my ninth-grade shop teacher.
		<B>B-</B></P>

	<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gryphons</SPAN><BR>
		These are the most famous example of the "Grranimals"
		school of mythical creatures, where you just take
		two or more sets of animal parts and jumble them 
		together. I imagine less successful results included
		things like a creature with the head of a badger and
		the body of a potato bug. <B>C</B></P>

I popped one of these smiling yellow crunchies into my mouth and chewed
thoughtfully, trying to identify the flavor. Fun-yun? Some twisted variety
of cheddar? I looked at the back, which thoughtfully had information in four 
languages including Great British. "Salted extruded maize with ham
flavour" it said. The sudden realization that you're chewing on ham-flavored
corn snacks is rather a startling thing to experience. I don't recommend it. <B>D</B></P></TD>

These don't contain actual fish, thank the indifferent gods. Between the
Japanese and Korean snacks, I've had enough of seafood-in-a-sack to
last me through several cycles of samsara. Rather,
these are potato chips <EM>shaped</EM> like fish, much like goldfish
crackers, only not gold and not crackers. The flavor is pretty much
run-of-the-mill sour cream and onion, but they're shaped like happy
puffy fish, which improves everything. <B>A</B></P></TD>

Or something like that. There are diacritics on some of the letters that

the package to provide hints here, but it appears to be a 
peanut-flavored salty crunchy snack puff, the kind of thing George
Washington Carver might have come up with if he were courting the youth

These are your basic potato chip, except they're paprika flavored. I've
always thought of paprika more as a deviled egg adornment than as an
actual flavor, so I was interested in tasting a snack dedicated to
the paprika experience. The paprika experience is gross, folks, at least
as it applies to potato chips. It tastes kind of like the "BBQ" powder
they put on chips in this country, only more vile. Which is odd, because
I had assumed BBQ powder was itself made out of distilled and dried 
vileness. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Milk</SPAN><BR>
The interesting thing about milk is the difficulty in adjusting to
any type other than what you drank as a kid. If you drank whole milk
chances are you consider non-fat to be little more than water, and
if you drank non-fat you probably find whole to be throat-pluggingly
rich. And now we're raising what will doubtlessly be known as the "one
percent generation." Thank God many people can compromise on two percent
or there'd probably be creamery bombings over this. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ice Cream</SPAN><BR>
Ice cream is the reason I'd never become a vegan even under
really annoying duress. Tofutti Cuties, adorable as they are, just don't
cut it. I'm not very discriminating with ice cream. Green tea ice cream,
ginger ice cream, limited edition Chunky Monkey with real monkey --
I enjoy flavors man was not meant to enjoy. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cheese</SPAN><BR>
I don't want to be a bummer here, but it's interesting that the whole
baby cow thing is heavily played up in the veal realm, and yet virtually
ignored in the cheese realm. It's called rennet, folks, it comes from
baby cows, and getting it from the baby cows in question is not an
outpatient procedure, if you follow me. But I'm sure the calves all had
<EM>happy</EM> and <EM>fulfilling</EM> lives before they were slaughtered
for your Kraft singles, right? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Half-and-half</SPAN><BR>
I like this because it sounds like some sort of compromise,
as if it were half cream and half sparkling water, rather than being half
buttloads of fat globules and the other half merely a single buttload.
It also often comes with really tempting little packaging units that
you can pop like a little pimple o' lactose while waiting for your Grand Slam.
Fun. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cottage Cheese</SPAN><BR>
Speaking of globules! Dairy with texture! The midwest's
answer to fish roe! The official diet food of the 1970's! Another in
the surging lists of signs we may have too many choices in this country
is that fact that you can choose your curd size. I've seen many pie
charts of what people consider important to them, but not even
the tiniest slice is devoted to curd size. The phrase "curd size" has
never even come up in conversation. It's a complete non-issue, and
yet you hit the dairy aisle and there you have it: choose your
own curd size. <B>C-</B></P>

rock, I enjoy the "death by Coke machine" symbol for one primary
reason: the guy looks like he's about to get super powers. A machine
full of chemical-laden soda is about to hit him, and meanwhile mysterious
lightning bolts are shooting towards his head. Isn't that pretty much
the Flash's origin? No doubt the combination of electricity, caffeine,

<p class="ratingbody">It isn't easy to sketch, but it gets the point across. Lesser minds
might have gone with pictograms of multiple-headed babies or breadloaf-sized
tumors, but the creators of the biohazard symbol managed to come up with
a completely abstract icon that nonetheless perfectly conveys the
concept "something nearby will fuck you and/or your offspring up
in a disturbingly organic manner." Plus it has radial symmetry, which
I always appreciate in life-threatening situations. <span class="ratinggrade">A+</span></p>

with the radiation symbol is that it has somehow become quaint and
anachronistic, in spite of the fact that radiation, as far as I know,
still exists. It brings to mind ducking and covering, underground
bunkers in the backyard, and black-and-white safety films featuring
turtles. You might as well replace all the radiation signs with a picture
of a clean-shaven, pipe-holding father figure and the caption "Now you

up with the owner of that hand? He seems to completely lack basic
self-preservation reflexes. The hand is calmly extended even as another
drop of Generic Corrosive Substance is hurtling towards it. It's as
if he's thinking "Maybe just the first drop eats through flesh like
a caterpillar on a mulberry leaf, and the rest is okay. I wouldn't
want the searing pain screaming up my arm to make me jump to conclusions."

costs if you're a poison pirate, but what about the rest of us?
Say you're exploring a tropical atoll in that way you always do,
and you come across a big carved wooden chest with a skull-and-crossbones
on it. What are you going to do? If it's a poison symbol the proper
response is to walk away and tell an adult. But if it's a pirate symbol
we're talking doubloons and pieces of eight and possibly some sort
of locket. Or say you witness a loved one chugging floor wax. After
a panicked flip through the front of the phone book, you accidentally

someone's eye being reduced to its constituent humours? I'm not
sure a laser warning symbol is useful, anyway. I have it on good authority
that most industrial laser beams aren't visible unless you're looking
straight into the laser device, so basically we have a situation where
peering around for the source of the hazard is the last thing you want
to do. Maybe the sign should say "Danger: Really Boring Area! Don't

I appreciate the need for a generic danger sign. You never know when
you're going to be in charge of some danger never before known to
man, like sentient pudding or something, but an exclamation point
doesn't mean "Danger" to me. It means "Charlie Brown is startled."
Perhaps we need to go back to the traditional sign of impending
danger: human heads on poles. They'd have to be sturdy poles, and
well-attached heads, though, or else you're going to need a
"Danger: Human Heads on Poles" sign. That would be too weird. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Opportunists</SPAN><BR>
These are people who refused to take sides on the whole good vs.
evil thing, but just looked after themselves. (That's "chaotic neutral"
for all you D&D fans.) As a result, they're doomed to forever run after
a banner while being stung by wasps and hornets. The funny thing here
is that these people aren't technically in hell. They're not evil enough
to be in hell, so they're in the VESTIBULE of hell. Being stung by wasps
forever. I didn't even know Hell HAD a vestibule. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Virtuous Pagans</SPAN><BR>
Another group that fell between the ecclesiastical cracks are those
who died before Christ made the scene. Never having experienced God's
word in the form of door-to-door missionaries, they just kind of hang
around and sigh about the fact that while not being tortured for all
time is nice and all, it's not as nice as heaven. I think this is that
"Leonard Cohen afterworld" Kurt Cobain was going on about. Except, um,
without Leonard Cohen. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Carnal</SPAN><BR>
Lustful people spend eternity in a dark damp whirlwind. This is poetic justice
in ways I'm not going into. I do want to point out, though, that this still
seems better than following a flag while being stung by wasps. There are
a lot of famous people here: Cleopatra, Helen, Tristan. If meeting celebrities
in unpleasant dark hangouts is what Hell's all about, it's even more
like LA than I suspected. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Gluttons</SPAN><BR>
Now we're getting into gruesome punishments. Gluttons can't eat or drink
in Hell because they ate and drank so much in life. And they are trapped
in putrid soil because they produced nothing but garbage in life. And
they are being torn apart constantly by Cerberus's three sets of bloody teeth,
because Dante is one sick motherfucker. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Hoarders and the Wasters</SPAN><BR>
Hoarders and wasters get the same punishment: they have to slam weights
against each other, then do it again forever. Of course, this is Hell,
so "do it again forever" is implied. Hell is all about job security. This
is kind of a lame punishment, but excessive hoarding or wasting
(Of what? Ketchup packets?) is kind of a lame sin. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Wrathful</SPAN><BR>
The punishment for the wrathful is to attack each other. Is it just me
or is this a briar-patch sort of "punishment"? If you're really wrathful,
you're probably going to dig on a chance to work out that anger by gouging
others. It's like punishing gluttons with ice cream sandwiches. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Sullen</SPAN><BR>
Sullen? Sullenness is a sin? The sort of sin that dooms you to spend
eternity in a slime-pit? Now I'm worried. How about crankiness? Poutiness?
Irascibility?  My God, what if <EM>irony</EM> is a sin? Yeah, I'd certainly be
overjoyed to find <EM>that</EM> out. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Heretics</SPAN><BR>
People in tombs writhe in flames, pretty standard. It's nice to finally
see some flames in Hell, I'd hate to think that all those Far Side
cartoons had no basis in reality. The odd bit here is that these souls
are a sub-genus of "The Violent," because they did violence to God by
denying immortality. I'm not sure how that's, technically speaking,
violent. But that's God for you, the all-huffy. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Violent Against Neighbors</SPAN><BR>
Now this is what I call violent. People who, you know, hit people.
These malcontents are doomed to wallow in a boiling river of blood, and if
they stop wallowing in blood they get shot by centaurs.  But hey,
at least they get a choice. If the boiling blood gets dull, they can
give the centaur pincushion thing a try for a while. Hey, it's Hell,
what do you want, doilies and candy jars? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Suicides</SPAN><BR>
Suicides get their souls trapped in trees which bleed when harpies eat
them. Take that, "Theme from M*A*S*H"! Anyhow, the suicides can only
speak while bleeding, but that doesn't seem like it would make much
of a difference. What are you going to talk about, it's not like there's
a game on. "So, still trapped in a tree made of Purina Harpy Chow, huh? Yeah,
me too. Ow." <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Blasphemers</SPAN><BR>
Burning sand and rains of fire, all for those who said things like
"Jesus fuck, that's one God-be-buggered big-ass fajita plate," plus
the entire London cast of Jesus Christ Superstar. It doesn't
make it clear whether you can get away with phrases like "Gosh darn
cripes," which would have been good to know. Anyhow, if you do these
things you have to lay down in the sand. I think it would have been
a more appropriate punishment for evil sunbathers, but that's why
I'm not Pope. Among other reasons. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Sodomites</SPAN><BR>
Sodomites have to run around the same burning plane on which the
blasphemers are lying down. I imagine some of you were expecting something
more intricate in terms of buttsex castigation, but what can you do? Dante
wrote in a time before Jim Carrey movies. Anyhow, Dante makes a big deal
out of how the Sodomites, being able to run free in the flaming burning
hell-rain, have a better deal than the blasphemers. This is called 
"compassionate conservatism." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Usurers</SPAN><BR>
This is an often-overlooked sin: the sin of charging interest.  Dante
describes this area as being less populated than some of the others,
but that's before Parker Brother made all of us who have been the banker
in Monopoly into degraded, fetid mortgage-issuing degenerates. Which
means that we're going to end up on the same field as the sodomites
and the blasphemers, only we have to crouch instead of running or lying
down. Kind of bland, but there you go. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Panderers and the Seducers</SPAN><BR>
Here we leave behind weird Italian definitions of violence and move
into good old fraud. At the head of the line are the panderers and
seducers, which I think indicates those who got other people laid
and those who got themselves laid. These sexual tag teams are punished 
being made to march by horned demons with huge whips from the covers
of heavy metal albums. Which albums in turn helped get people laid,
so we've got a self-sustaining ecology here. Sort of. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Flatterers</SPAN><BR>
Here we start to see Dante reusing some of his motifs. Whereas the
sullen were sunk in slime, the flatterers are sunk in excrement. Which
proves that maybe you should say nothing at all even if you CAN say
something nice. Sincere love of humanity seems to be the safest bet,
but let's be realistic here. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Simoniacs</SPAN><BR>
This is not a term for people who attend "Simon and Simon" fan
conventions, but rather the selling of church offices. I didn't even know
that was an option. Well, aside from The Church of Universal Life, but I
figure Dante's problems with the Church of Universal Life wouldn't stop
there. Anyhow, simoniacs get their feet lit on fire, whatever. There's a
Pope in this section. Dante had all sorts of Popes in Hell. It's, like,
Pope Central. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fortune Tellers</SPAN><BR>
Diviners, oracles, astrologers, myomancers, day traders and people who save their fortune cookie fortunes are doomed to forever walk around with their heads turned backwards, crying tears into their butt-cracks. Dante very specifically specifies that their tears flow between their ass cheeks. Not an image I ever wanted to have poked into my brain, but you have to admire the attention to detail. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Grafters</SPAN><BR>
Okay, I'm getting really tired of the "buried sinners" motif. Grafters are buried in pitch. And if they try to get out of the pitch, they're torn apart by demons. Come <EM>on,</EM> Dante! It's only Canto XXI and you're already out of ideas? How about they all have to lick nine-volt batteries while barking their shins on the devil's own walnut coffee table? And they have to wear wet jeans and their ears are being devoured by very angry caterpillars. <EM>There's your punishment.</EM> <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hypocrites</SPAN><BR>
Okay, I'm not sure here whether hypocrisy is a sin in and of itself, or whether it's just that hypocritical murderers are bumped down to a lower level of hell than plain old regular murderers who are completely upfront about their interest in the whole murder thing. At any rate, hypocrites have to walk around -- again with the walking around -- wearing robes which look golden but which are really lead, because, well, if you're not picking up on the irony there I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go. Also, everybody is walking on Caiaphas, presumably because he sang "One thing I'll say for him, Jesus is cool" in <CITE>Jesus Christ Superstar</CITE>. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thieves</SPAN><BR>
The punishment if you're a thief is having snakes tie your hands behind your back. And then sometimes the snakes bite your neck and you burn into ashes and then you arise again from the ashes. And you're naked. Which just goes to show you that one person's eternal ignominious torture is another person's fetish art Web page. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Evil Counselors</SPAN><BR>
I just like the idea of Evil Counselors having their own section in Hell. Buncha bad guys from Disney cartoons and bad fantasy literature, clutching their snake staves in their gnarled hands and complaining about how killing all the firstborn males shouldn't be that tough a job, really. Anyhow, they have to spend eternity hidden from sight in flames, which is dull. But the counselors are neat. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Sowers of Discord</SPAN><BR>
Here we have yet another permutation of the "walking around and being abused by demons" theme. The sowers of discord walk in a circle, get hacked up a bunch by a demon, and heal as they walk around the circle so they can get hacked up real good again. Is this a metaphor for: a. The cycle of chaos caused by sowers of discord? b. The futility of absolution without true repentance? or c. Working a retail job?  <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Alchemists, Counterfeiters and False Witnesses</SPAN><BR>
These falsifiers are subjected to a demonic everything bagel of torture; darkness, stench, disease, thirst, filth, and really loud noise. It lacks poetry, except in the literal sense, but you've got to admit it would be pretty unpleasant to deal with. In fact, I'm giving up alchemy right now. I just got this cool philosopher's stone from the Fingerhut catalog, but no, out it goes. I feel...cleaner now. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Evil Impersonators</SPAN><BR>
Evil impersonators! I want to be an evil impersonator! How do you get that gig? I mean, yeah, I could just look in the evil impersonator section of the want ads, but they always want, like, five years of experience in evil impersonation. I need to break in somehow. I'd be a great evil impersonator. I'd be very, very evil and also very identical. And then I'd die and have to run through a pit snatching at other dead people and being snatched at myself. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Treacherous to Kin and Country</SPAN><BR>
Okay, the fuckers who betrayed random bonds of genes or nationality are stuck in ice, with their heads stuck up above the ice.

A really polluting flamethrower. But no, you just get guys who weren't big on indentured servitude. And the punishment? They're encased in ice. That's right, we're back on the immersion trail.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sport Scent</SPAN><BR>
What, exactly, does "sport" smell like. If someone
were to ask me to imagine the smell of "sport," I'd
think of the exact scent that deodorant was invented
to disguise, namely unwashed Rugby armpits. I suppose
the idea is to portray yourself as someone who
has played sports in the recent past, and may very well play sports 
again, but do City Sanitation Department employees
wear "Sewer Scent" deodorant? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fresh Scent</SPAN><BR>
The question, of course, is "fresh what"? Fresh engine oil,
for instance, wouldn't really hold up against, say,
two-week-old dried lavender as a deodorant scent. Maybe it's
supposed to smell like fresh <EM>deodorant</EM>, straight out of the
vat the way mom used to make it. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Musk Scent</SPAN><BR>
My first experience with the word "musk" was in an
article about skunks in <CITE>Ranger Rick</CITE> magazine,
which, combined with a picture of a musk ox a couple
issues later, makes me skeptical of "musk" as a positive
description. In reality, you end up smelling like a really
manly pumpkin pie, which is only a notch or two above
my first impression. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Powder Scent</SPAN><BR>
By "powder" here they mean "baby powder," but they don't
put "baby" in the name. I assume this is because they're
trying to market to the lucrative demographic of "people
who want to smell like babies, but who don't want to 
admit to themselves that they want to smell like babies."
I wonder if the same marketing team that came up with this
is also responsible for the recent abbreviation of "Baby Boomers"
to just "Boomers." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Original Scent</SPAN><BR>
I'm against "original" scents, flavors, or styles. I find it appalling
that companies assume that I'm so intimately familiar with their
product line that I know which item is the original, and which were
afterthoughts. Would you buy "original flavor" Jell-O? Would
you buy a car knowing only that it had "original style" transmission?
Let's stand up as one and eliminate "original" as a product descriptor,
except for "Original Flavor" ramen noodles, because what else are you
going to call it? <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hash Browns</SPAN><BR>
The unwritten law of diner food is that the dishes served
are not intended to be palatable in and of themselves, but rather are
intended as substrates for such condiments as ketchup, Tabasco sauce,
and the bitter tang of lost love. As such, hash browns (or, in your
classier dives, "hashed browns") are the perfect platform of starch,
fat, and salt upon which to build your dining experience. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Eggs</SPAN><BR>
"Eggs any style" really means "eggs either style," scrambled or
fried. Theoretically you can order your fried eggs in a variety of
consistencies, but "over medium" is likely to get you a shrug in most
diners, followed by a plate of whatever type of fried egg the cook felt
like making. "Poached" will get you a cold stare. Mentioning chives will
get you ejected. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coffee</SPAN><BR>
Of all things served in the diner, coffee is the most crucial. It's
not that it needs to be good -- it won't be. The critical point is
that the tables have coffee cups on them when you sit down, and that an
upturned and empty coffee cup is regarded as a blasphemous sin against
God and nature. Any diner that regards coffee as something you order,
rather than something you drink to make it possible to order, should be
investigated by the authorities. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Biscuits and Gravy</SPAN><BR>
Normally I don't have high standards for diner
food, but I do prefer my "country gravy" not to have the taste of
aluminum. Canned gravy goes beyond simple blandness and into the magical
land of wood glue. Actual gravy made in the diner, on the other hand,
can be merely bad and thus acceptable. A hint to tell the difference:
if the menu says "our country gravy" it's probably made from something
resembling scratch. If it says "real country gravy," it's can opener time.
<B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chicken Fried Steak</SPAN><BR>
This is what late-night/early-morning diner food is
all about. You take a bad cut of beef. You dredge it in flour and deep-fry
that mother. You cover it with gravy. Then you serve it with eggs and
hash browns. Incredibly enough, after eating this 100% fat gram repast,
it's still considered bad manners to fall asleep or die at the 
table. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Brontosaurus</B></BIG><BR>Huge beast. Ate only 
plants, but could crush a '93 Cabriolet with a single step of 
its titanic brontosaurus feet. Name means "Thunder Lizard" 
which is about as cool as you can get. Its only real drawback 
is that it didn't really exist. <B>B+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Apatosaurus</B></BIG><BR>This is what they're calling 
brontosauruses these days. Apparently they had some 
problem with the wrong skull on the wrong body--duh--and 
once they figured it out they had to change the name to 
"apatosaurus," which means "Deceptive Lizard." Personally 
I think they should have looked up the Latin for "Stupid 
Scientist." <B>D</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Dimetrodon</B></BIG><BR>Looks like a gecko with a 
mohawk. Big sail on its back that they think attracted mates 
or conserved body heat. Actually, that's what scientists say 
about anything on an animal they don't understand. They 
could find evidence of an iguanadon with a ZZ Top beard 
and they'd say "the beard was probably to conserve body 
heat or attract mates." Which, come to think of it, is 
probably what ZZ Top uses them for. Anyhow, 
<B>C</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Tyrannosaurus Rex</B></BIG><BR>
<B>Cool</B> animal. Name means "Tyrant Lizard 
King." Cool. I wish <B>my</B> name meant 
"Tyrant Lizard King." Anyhow, we all know what makes 
this such a great dinosaur--it could completely eat you. Plus 
the little tiny forearms make it look like some demented 
nightmare beast from the fertile mind of Tim Burton. 
<B>A+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Velociraptor</B></BIG><BR>These guys got a lot of 
press from "Jurassic Park," but let's face it, they're pretty 
lacking. They couldn't even manage to eat two little kids, 
one of whom had only minutes before been turned into a 
toaster pastry. Sure, they got the hunter, but he was coming 
up with cute last words when he should have been running 
like a bunny. And then all three of them got totally worked 
by a baby Tyrannosaurus! Lame! <B>D!</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Stegosaurus</B></BIG><BR>Two words: spiked tail. 
"Oh, so you're sneaking up behind me to eat my delicious 
body? <STRONG>WHAM!</STRONG> Spikes! For you! In your 
head!" Plus it had I-am-an-industrial-monster plates on its 
back, which while probably for conserving body heat or 
attracting mates, were impressive-looking.

<P><B>Iguanadon</B><BR>
Aladar, the proto-protagonist from the Disney Dinosaur movie, was an
Iguanadon. They didn't play that up much in the promotional material,
because "Iguanadon" is a dumb name. It means "Iguana Tooth," which
sounds like one of those inexplicable taunts third graders make up if
your name doesn't rhyme with "butt" or "fart." The other thing is that
Iguanadons had a pointy thumb-like appendage which sticks straight up
in most Iguanadon portrayals, which makes the things look like they're
patiently waiting for Peterbilt to be founded so they can hitch a ride
to the next Phish concert. <B>C</B></P>

<P><B>Sauroposeidon</B><BR>
Those whole "largest dinosaur" thing is tough to track down, because
"Fun Fact" placemats aren't known for their exacting fact-checking. For
a while there, UIltrasaurus was the main contender, except there were two
types of Ultrasauri and they weren't actually all that big and it was all
pretty stupid. Anyhow, near as I can tell, the most recent candidate for
"biggest-assed creature of all time" is the Sauroposeidon ("Earthquake
God Lizard"). The Sauroposeidon was also one of the last of the dinosaurs;
there's some sort of moral there, but I don't think it applies to me. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><B>Pterodactyl</B><BR>
Pterodactyls are cool for two obvious reasons: they can fly and
they have a silent "p." The same applies to Pteranadons, of course,
but we've already established that paleontologists worry about teeth
too much. Anyhow, Pterodactyl either couldn't really fly, instead only
gliding, or it couldn't fly very well. But Pterodactyl-shaped transforming
robot cartoon characters can fly, and that's what's really important. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><B>Pleisiosaur</B><BR>
Completing the prehistoric triathlon, Pleisiosaur is a seagoing dinosaur,
if you take the word dinosaur to include "things that are not technically
speaking dinosaurs but end up in the dinosaur section of the plush toy
aisle nonetheless." As with other reptiles of the era, we're not sure
exactly what Pleisiosaur looked like, but we are absolutely certain that
it was huggable and a friend to all the children. Also, scientists are
completely sure that any mysterious lake monsters that are not actually
floating logs or delirium tremens are Pleisiosaurs. <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>Oviraptor</B><BR>
This creature's name means "egg stealer." It is so named because it does
not steal eggs. When the first Oviraptor fossil was found, it was on
top of some eggs, so the discoverers drew the obvious conclusion that
it was stealing them. This is because it was discovered by the LAPD. As
it turns out, those were probably the thing's <EM>own</EM> eggs. But,
okay, they think that the species as a whole may have eaten eggs&nbsp;--
other creatures' eggs&nbsp;-- anyway. It just seems like the sort of
thing they'd do. I'm going back to bed. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Magic-User</SPAN><BR>
 There are so many good names for magicians -- Wizard, Mage,
The Amazing Zappo -- that it's a pity that the designers of D&D didn't
come up with something less stilted. "Magic-User" has so little flair that
they may as well have called them "Paranormal Effects Administrators." The
other problems with Magic-Users are that at the start they can easily be
laid out by even the most lame of subterranean denizens and they have
a grand total of one spell per day to use. You cast "magic missile"
once and you're dead weight for the rest of the day. Sure, eventually
you can cast lots of room clearing fireball spells and the like, but by
then everyone's carrying Swords of Casual Dismemberment and Amulets of
Pretty Much Instant Death anyway. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thief</SPAN><BR>
You'd think people would catch on that maybe searching out and
recruiting people who readily admit to amoral lawbreaking isn't a Nobel
prizewinning idea. In the groups I played in Junior High, there was always
the thief who loved to practice his pickpocket skills on other members of
the group. In retrospect it doesn't make a lot of sense to filch a couple
medieval quid from a heavily armed swordsman who's spending his time and
energy killing ugly beasts so that you can share in the loot, but Junior
High School D&D players have never been known for their social insights. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fighter</SPAN><BR>
Slightly better than "Magic-User" as a name. At least fighter
is more specific. You fight. End of story. Fighters make a lot of sense
as a character class: you get to wade into battle, the princess always
makes a pass at you, and you've got clerics to serve as walking first
aid kits and halflings to serve as shields. Names are easy to come up
with: just combine a manly-sounding name with a dangerous-sounding title,
and whoom! You're Zagor the Bloodletter. Or Palthon the Intimidating. Or
whatever. Sure, you don't get lots of little tricks and magic spells and
such, but once you find the aforementioned ridiculously powerful magic
items you won't much care. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cleric</SPAN><BR>
When I did a Rating of Chess Pieces, I scoffed at the idea
of bishops in battle and was served my comeuppance from several
astute readers who have a keener grasp of the history of warfare than
I. Apparently kicking holy ass is not all that historically inaccurate
after all. Thus Clerics, who aren't allowed to use swords because they
can't spill blood, as if you can pound a bugbear to a pulp with a mace
and still not muss the polish on your riding boots. Clerics also have the
power to heal, which has established itself as an important skill in the
gore-laced world of roleplaying games. Supposedly this power is bestowed
by the gods, but in all the games I've played, healing is treated with
all the awe-struck reverence given to ordering an Extra Value Meal. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Paladin</SPAN><BR>
The Paladin is a holy warrior, basically a cross between a
fighter and a Mormon missionary. Paladins are typically played in one
of two styles: the "completely overblown" style, in which the character
is always going on about God and/or the gods, praying at the drop of a
helm, and giving assassins the benefit of the doubt, or the "completely
indifferent" style, in which the character pretty much does whatever he
wants, only his sword glows. <B>D+</B></P>

<p class="ratingbody">As far as I know, the idea of a six-legged
panther with squid tentacles that looks like it's somewhere other
than it really is originated in the mind of D&D creator
E. Gary Gygax, possibly as the result of blunt trauma. Not that
I'm complaining. The displacer beast is an excellent example of
synergy; a panther with squid parts is considerably more intimidating
than a squid strapped to a panther. My main complaint with the
name. Not only is it alarmingly prosaic, shouldn't it be called
a "displacing beast"? We don't call flying fish "flyer fish." We
don't refer to the Ukrainian burrowing elk as a "Ukrainian burrower elk." On the other
hand we do have leafcutter ants and nipple-kisser voles, but it
just sounds wrong to me.

githyanki (plural, "whole bunch of githyanki") live on the Astral Plane,
which is a place adventurers can go when they've completely wrecked
the economy of their home world by flooding it with gold and portable
holes. They often have silver swords that can cut the magical cord
binding astrally projected creatures to their home dimensions, which
I'm led to understand in badass. This is entirely mitigated by the
fact that they look like angry, emaciated Smurfs.

Secondly, the brain eating is not purely metaphorical. This thing

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stay</SPAN><BR>
Handy if it works. I've heard tell that there are dogs
that have been taught to stay even if there's raw meat
six feet in front of them. That's got to go against every
strand in dog DNA. I'd have imagined that even if you
could get the dog's body to stay put, its brain would leap out
of its skull, bounce across the lawn, and start gnawing on the
steak with its medulla. It just goes to show the power of a
charismatic primate. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fetch</SPAN><BR>
"Fetch" obviously enough, isn't the trick. The trick is
"Having fetched, bring the object back and actually let
me have it, rather than turning this into a rousing game of
'hand vs. jaw.'" The really cool fetchers are the frisbee fetchers,
the ones that throw themselves up into the air with wild abandon
and look like they should be in an
ad for some translucent-green citrus sports drink or another.
It's a great sport, and yet it's the only one that hasn't been
featured on ESPN2 yet. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Play Dead</SPAN><BR>
Isn't this kind of morbid? Outside of heart-wrenching
family films, what is the appeal here? Do
the people who train their dogs to play dead also teach
them tricks like "fake a bad case of roundworms"? Or is
this just the trick that comes free with every dog, given that
"play dead" is basically equivalent to "lie on the ground and
ignore all non-food stimuli"? <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sit</SPAN><BR>
I've known many dogs who are trained to sit given only the subtle 
physical signal of grabbing their hindquarters and shoving
them downward forcefully. The signal for "lie down" takes two people,
and the signal for "heel" involves waiting patiently for your dog
to get bored with whatever it's chasing, sniffing, and/or marking.
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Come</SPAN><BR>
This, like many tricks, is based on the dog's intrinsic faith that
food may suddenly become available at any time, so you have to follow
up all your leads. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that the sorts of
dogs who trot around the circle at British dog shows do this
and other tricks out of fierce loyalty to the Alpha Mammal, but
your average neighborhood-roaming sloppy dog is working on the
knowledge that humans produce food at unpredictable intervals. 
But hey, whatever works. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Speak</SPAN><BR>
This can be kind of fun, although it goes along with "Beg" into
the class of "Tricks it Would Be More Impressive to Teach Your
Dog <EM>Not</EM> to Do." I've lived next to dogs that had gone way
past "speak" into "filibuster." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Old Fashioned Doughnuts</SPAN><BR>
When, exactly, did these become "old fashioned"? Were
they ever known as "those new-fangled modern doughnuts"?
Were they once favorites of lawless young punks looking
for cheap thrills and greasy pastries, before a brash
new crop of cutting-edge crullers rendered them "uncool"?
Are retro-minded modern youths reviving the old-fashioned
doughnut craze, going to old-fashioned doughnut bars and
subscribing to magazines devoted to the finer points
of chocolate-coated versus plain? Or maybe, just maybe, it's just
a dumb name. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jelly Doughnuts</SPAN><BR>
You can tell a lousy doughnut shop by how much they skimp on the
bright red sugary ichor.  Some of the real cheapies stick no more than
a heaping teaspoon of coagulated goodness in there, making you wade
through mouthfuls of dry, flavorless breadlike material to even get
to it. In spite of this very real danger, however, jelly doughnuts are
primally appealing, because the oozing preserves are about as close as
most air-conditioned urban dwellers are going to get to the look and
feel of devouring fresh kill. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fritters</SPAN><BR>
This sounds like something you get infested with on
a camping trip. "Better get out the lye soap, Ma. Looks like 
Beanie's got fritters again." And if you don't get them
off fast enough, you get Rocky Mountain Fritter Fever and
you end up six feet under with the word "fritter" on your death
certificate. Bad scene. But not as bad as these things look.
They look as if the final step in their preparation 
is "change the oil in your pickup truck using the fritter
as a drain pan." They don't taste quite that bad, though. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cake Doughnuts with Chocolate Sprinkles</SPAN><BR>
Some things took me much longer to learn than they should have.
One example is "Nothing anyone tells you in a student financial
aid office will ever be verified by another human being." Another
is "Chocolate sprinkles just aren't worth it." Sure, they look
all fun and festive, like a crowded disco of chocolatey goodness.
The problem is that whatever process they use to form the chocolate
into little chromosomes also takes away approximately
85 percent of the flavor, leaving them tasting vaguely sugary
and disturbingly crunchy. Plus they get all over the place.
Two or three of them on the road and your car floor looks
like a shaving basin. Chocolate good, chocolate sprinkles <B>D</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Maple Bars</SPAN><BR>
You'll be glad to know that this rating is 100% guaranteed
free of Canadian jokes. Don't worry, eventually I'll 
rate international police uniforms and then they'll get it
but good, but for now we'll let them slide, if only because
the "maple" you find at a doughnut shop couldn't be more removed
from actual trees if it came from Pluto's moon. Real maple syrup,
for instance, doesn't have a four-hour aftertaste. I propose
we apply the same principle behind "creme," "froot" and "cheez"
and make them change the signs to read "maypul bars." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Glazed Doughnuts</SPAN><BR>
I like these because usually when I walk into a doughnut shop
I feel pretty glazed myself. They are the quintessential doughnut,
allowing you to feel bloated and yet not satiated. The addition
of a layer of sugar to the already sugar-infused greasebomb is
a nice touch of overkill, so much so that "glazing the doughnut"
would make a nice replacement for "gilding the lily" as a metaphor
when describing, for instance, the effect of putting whitewall
tires on an expensive mobile home. <B>A</B></P>

the key to the game was not skill, reflexes, or even intelligence,
but rather memorization. The video games section of Waldenbooks was
filled with books that told you the exact moves to make at the exact
time, making mastery of Pac-Man only faintly more impressive than
memorizing the first hundred digits of pi. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Night Driver</SPAN><BR>
Before video game makers figured out that what you really want to
do is beat up on guys with names like "Goro," they were busy turning
some of the most unpleasant aspects of modern life into video 
games. Witness Night Driver, which was an uncanny simulation of
driving a car at night when you can't see anything. Whoo! Coming
soon: Night Driver II, which adds a simulation of an overheating 
radiator and an eight-year-old throwing up in the back seat. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Donkey Kong</SPAN><BR>
Frankly, I'm a little tired of everyone's favorite digital Italian.
I think it was "Mario Teaches Typing" that did it for me. But back
when Mario was a bit player and video game names were routinely
poorly translated from the Japanese, there was a little story of
a jumping guy, a blonde, and a giant ape with an inexplicably
interminable supply of barrels. This was great! The music was great!
The sound effects were great! That one level (out of, like, four) with
the conveyor belts and the pies was great! We were pathetic then, and
we didn't even care. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tetris</SPAN><BR>
If we ever meet up with an alien civilization, I'm betting they won't have
Tetris, which will work to our advantage:</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pong</SPAN><BR>
Look. Table tennis is not that interesting of a game. TV is not that
interesting of a medium. I can't imagine why combining the two was
such a hit, but hey, it was the early seventies, when corduroy was king.
I bought an ancient Pong game at a thrift store a while back, rushed it
home, hooked it up, and within seconds I was bored. So I played 
"Sewer Blaster Kombat 64" instead, which was also boring, but at 
least it was colorful. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Colored Eggs</SPAN><BR>
Yeah, sure, garishly pastel hen ova are fun and all, and it's
reasonably diverting to run all over hell and gone looking for
them. But then when you're done, what do you have? Maybe a dozen
hard boiled eggs. Either these have to be eaten -- no small task for
those of us who consider hard-boiled eggs to be just this side of inedible --
or chucked into the trash, which hardly seems to be an appropriate
fertility-rite-cum-resurrection-tribute. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Plastic Grass</SPAN><BR>
I like plastic grass, and I'm not sure why. I also like plastic flowers
and the little plastic leaf thingy you get with grocery-store sushi, so
apparently I'm pretty positive towards all forms of plastic vegetation.
Not as a replacement for regular vegetation, mind you. I enjoy plastic
plants in the same way that I enjoy tribute albums: as an educational,
interesting, and sometimes embarrassingly laughable reinterpretation of
a classic. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chocolate Bunnies</SPAN><BR>
I'm not going to get too baroque here: it's chocolate and it's sculpted.
Nothing to complain about there. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Easter Bunny</SPAN><BR>
I think we need to funnel more tax money into holiday pooka research.
Modern science has yet to come to a consensus on many important
Easter Bunny issues: Is he a big human-sized rabbit or a small more-or-less
rabbit-sized rabbit?  Is he white or pink? And, perhaps the question with
the most potential social fallout, does he or does he not lay eggs? These
are important questions, and they're being virtually ignored. Oh, and
what exactly is a "bunny trail"? <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Peeps</SPAN><BR>
Borderline fluorescent edible farm animals are my thing. I don't much care
for the recent rabbit-shaped additions to the Peeps line, but that's
only because they're shaped like greeting-card cartoon rabbits, not actual
pellet-munching mammals. If they managed to make them look like doe-eyed
bunnies hunkered down and awaiting their grisly fate, they'd be much more
fun to eat. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Omelets</SPAN><BR>
I like food with interchangeable ingredients. It's like the
culinary equivalent of Legos, only it hurts less
when you pull it apart with your teeth. Omelets score big
points on this front, because most breakfast places give you
a big list of crap you can have folded into that bad boy, and
often you'll run into some weird item you'd never have considered.
Dijon mustard? Cottage cheese? Fatback? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Devilled</SPAN><BR>
Hard-boiled eggs, as I've mentioned previously, are not my cup on
animal protein. But it's a proud tradition of my Arkie heritage that
there's nothing that can't be improved with some mayonnaise, and that
everything looks fancy with paprika sprinkled on it. Thus, the devilled
egg. It also works if you just toss out the yolk and fill the egg
cavity with aerosol cheese. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fried</SPAN><BR>
It's a sign of my increasing maturity that if I break the yolk on
my fried eggs I no longer go into a week-long depression. A big help
in this direction was getting over my sense of inferiority to
Denny's short order cooks. I realized that the reason I never get
a broken yolk at a restaurant is because the cooks can trash any
failures. For all I know, it took a carton of eggs for the cook
to get me a perfect pair of fried eggs. Two cartons if I ordered
the Extra Slam. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scrambled</SPAN><BR>
I dunno, scrambled eggs don't, you know, do it for me. They're so
homogeneous. I always end up adding onions and garlic and cheese and
whatnot to them, and at that point you've basically made an omelet you
stir. As excuses to pull out the Tabasco go, they're okay, but
nothing to send the pastor email about. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Coddled</SPAN><BR>
I like coddled eggs. I didn't know what they were until ten minutes ago,
but I liked them already. It just sounds good. It's nice to live in
a society so luxurious that we can coddle our breakfast dishes. I think
we should go all the way and make mollycoddled eggs. Nothing's too good
for our eggs. <B>C+</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Hydrogen</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I really want to see hydrogen succeed, if only to prove to the world what you can accomplish with only one proton. The fact is, however, that hydrogen is the loser element. Thus far it has been associated with exploding airships, nonexistent cold fusion, unpopular personal transports, and vegetable oil that isn't actually better for you than butter. With a resume like that, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that hydrogen was behind the XFL and the sequels to the Matrix. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Helium</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Helium is like hydrogen's laid-back brother, the one whose major life goal is to own all of Buffy on DVD, and he's already got seasons one and two. Fun guy to hang out with, knows good jokes, but you can't help but think he's a bit of a slacker. Helium seems pretty happy filling party balloons, making voices squeaky, and adding another camera angle to the Super Bowl. He also might be a non-polluting by-product of certain futuristic power sources, but eh. By-product. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Terbium/Ytterbium/Erbium/Yttrium</p>
<p class="ratingbody">All four of these rare earth metals are named after the same town in Sweden, so they have to share an entry. You want your element to get individual attention, put some work into the name, dammit. I could understand if all the good names were taken, but in a world where "kaboomium," "explodium," and "pornographium" <em>still</em> do not exist, there's just no excuse. It's just as well, though, because these are about as boring as a metallic element can be, and that's within four degress of absolute boring. Yttrium is the standout in the group, and that's just because it assists in some way in creating the color red on phosphor-based television sets. It's the element equivalent of meeting Penn Jillette's travel agent at a party. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Seaborgium</p>
<p class="ratingbody">What I like about seaborgium is that enough has been created in the laboratory to get it on the periodic table, but not enough to actually see. So they don't really know much about it, except that it doesn't stick around for long. Personally I'm not convinced that you should ge to name an element until you produce enough of it to dare someone to eat it, but I don't make the rules. There are actually several of these phantom elements, but I'm arbitrarily picking this one to talk about because it's the only one that sounds like it might attack your ship in a Ray Harryhausen film. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Carbon</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The great thing about carbon is that you can crush it to make diamonds if you're Superman and if you ignore certain thermodynamic principles. He did it all the time, too, it was one of his shticks. Every time he wanted to propose to Lois Lane or replace the needle on his turntable or simply make the point that, yes, he can crush charcoal into diamonds, it was the old diamond-fist again. I bet he ruined a lot of barbecues with that one. "Okay, let's get this grill started, we'll just grab some briquettes and the hey? Diamonds! Damn you, Superman!" <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Oxygen</p>
<p class="ratingbody">O2 is the rose and thorns of the biosphere. On one hand, it gives and sustains life, making possible the existence of every single living thing on the planet, with the exception of anaerobic bacteria, and they're all jerks. On the other hand, it blows up. On one hand, it makes fire possible, setting early hominids on the road to the discovery of civilization. On the other hand, it rusts stuff. On one hand, it is essential to the existence of water, cool mother to us all and refresher of our bodies. On the other hand, it makes Tequiza possible. Toss-up, really. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Silicon</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The phrase "carbon-based life forms," so popular with science fiction writers and people making jokes about science fiction writers, immediately brings up the question of alternatives. Assuming you want to avoid bizarre options like electromagnetic-based life forms and pleasant-thoughts-about-fondue-based life forms, silicon is a pretty good option, for reasons I don't really understand or care about. It's carbon-esque, I guess. Anyhow, silicon-based life forms would probably melt instead of burning, and they'd probably smell like ozone when you did something to piss them off, such as forgetting their birthday. Important silicon note: jokes involving a pun on silicon/silicone are no longer funny. They ceased to be funny in April 1982. Please stop. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Radon</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I admit to a soft spot in my heart for the noble gases. It takes a lot of character to be able to avoid the temptation to give up an electron or two to oxygen or similarly alluring elements. It's all I can do to not buy a fruit pie every time I stop for gas. Radon is interesting because it's
both noble and deadly, like Vlad the Impaler. And, unlike the other noble gases,
Radon has its own month: January is National Radon Action Month! BIFF! POW! DECAY INTO POLONIUM-218! <span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Titanium</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm not clear on the metallurgic properties of titanium. I'm not sure why they make golf clubs and bicycle frames out of it, but I believe in titanium, because it has a kick-ass name. It sound like the perfect metal for the giant rocket-shooting robots, galaxy-spanning spaceships, and technologically advanced pleasure toys of the future. In fact, if titanium doesn't work out for these purposes, I propose we take the name "titanium" for whatever substance is used in those things and rename titanium "golfclubium" or something. <span class="ratinggrade">B+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Technetium</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Okay, if you sell more than half a million copies of your album, you get a gold record. And if you sell a million, you get a platinum record. So far so good. But the next step up, 10 million records, gets you a diamond record. Come on, RIAA marketing goons! Can't you think of another expensive metal? How about technetium? Not only is it massively expensive, it has to be created under laboratory conditions and has a half-life of about six hours. Just like most pop bands! Ah, the social satire flows fast and thick here at Ratings central. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<!--#set var="keywords" value="ratings" -->

<p class="ratingheader">The Hair</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Elvis, like Groucho, is one of those celebrities you can imitate with a single prosthesis. If you have a black DA the height of a modest wedding cake, and sideburns big enough to require their own Roomba, you <em>are</em> Elvis. A sneer and a mumbled "thankyewverramush" are helpful, but not required. I'm not sure what you are if you have Elvis hair <em>and</em> Groucho glasses, but I think it's the sort of thing that gets central European peasants to stock up on pitchforks and torches. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Hips</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The fun thing about fifties censorship is that it's so quaint. Rock stars were routinely condemned for wearing suggestive tie tacks and attending unchaperoned taffy pulls. Certainly, Elvis's hip thrusts were suggestive of a vigorous boning, or more precisely of a rodeo event wherein one is required to sodomize a frisky Guernsey calf without using one's hands, but at this point we as a society have seen bands wearing socks on their genitals and Elton John and Eminem french kissing on national television, so a mimed calf-fucking doesn't strike us as that scandalous. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Jumpsuits</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I am told that Elvis patterned the jumpsuit-and-glitter look of this later years after the comic book character Captain Marvel, making him the most popular superhero-based rock star if we ignore Madonna's short-lived Iron Man phase. He also managed to pioneer the practice of throwing sweat-soaked articles of clothing at adoring women, something that doesn't work as often as you'd like, and doesn't work on librarians <em>at all</em>. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Death</p>
<p class="ratingbody">To really secure your place in history you have to die. Otherwise there's always the chance that you'll do something to screw things up like convert to an unpopular religion or release "Flowers in the Dirt." It's especially handy if you die unexpectedly, if you die under seedy circumstances, and if you manage to get people to seriously discuss the possibility that you faked your death. Nice hat trick, Elvis! <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The  Movies</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Elvis movies are pleasantly unchallenging. There's this girl, there are other guys, singing is accomplished, other cultures are explored in an embarrassingly condescending way. It's fun! Plus, each movie is guaranteed to contain at least one dazzlingly surreal moment involving a woman's ass, usually involving either a spanking or some bizarre pop music mating ritual. <span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dodo</SPAN><BR>
The poster bird for the whole extinction deal, presumably because
it was harmless and sort of cute, which is how we like our animals.
It would be interesting to attempt to determine what's deader,
something dead as a dodo or something dead as a doornail. Doornails
still exist, but they were never alive in the first place, so it's
sort of a wash. The name, by the way, basically means "moron" in
the Portuguese of the time. That's insult to injury on a very visceral
level. You're a happy flightless bird, you waddle up to your interesting
new visitors and WHAM with a stick. And then they call you a moron. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Passenger Pigeon</SPAN><BR>
The thing you always hear about passenger pigeons is that they once
covered the sky like a blanket when migrating. Now, don't get me
wrong, I certainly don't want to wipe out even the most annoying and
inconvenient of God's creatures, but that doesn't seem like the sort
of thing that our society would put up with for long. Let's just say
that if someone managed to clone passenger pigeons and restore them to
their former sun-eclipsing glory, and once again "the dung fell in spots,
not unlike melting flakes of snow" as Audubon put it, this person would
not be receiving the Nobel Prize for Things People Appreciate. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Quagga</SPAN><BR>
I definitely think this one was a terrible loss, if only because I love
the word "quagga." A group of South Africans is attempting to breed
quaggas back into existence, but in the meantime I think we should name
something else "quagga" just to keep the name in circulation. There
are people who object to these attempts to re-create extinct animals
on the grounds that it will make people less concerned about wiping out
entire species. I can see their point: "What do you mean the condors
have all been wiped out? We've got a whole vial of 'em right 
here." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Irish Elk</SPAN><BR>
I thought I'd drop one in that isn't our fault. This one died out
somewhere around 10,000  years ago, which rules out even the Portuguese.
Like many of us, it was actually neither Irish nor an elk, and like many
of us it was the center of a theological controversy. A vocal contingent
argued that God would never allow an animal to become extinct and that
we were sure to find a living specimen if only we searched thoroughly
and checked under our car seats. Aren't you glad that we've moved on
from such silly dogma and on to more scientific questions like whether
the dinosaurs all drowned in The Flood? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Great Auk</SPAN><BR>
The sad thing here is that our children will never know how truly
great an auk can be. They'll gaze upon a Razor-Billed Auk or perhaps a 
Craveri's Murrelet and they'll say "Wow! That's a great auk!" and we'll
lower our eyes and sadly sigh to ourselves, knowing that true
auk greatness has been removed from the world forever. Is it just
me or does "Craveri's Murrelet" sound like an enchanted treasure from
a D&D game? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Fox and the Grapes</SPAN><BR>
I'm not sure what the point is here. The moral is "It is easy to despise
what you cannot get," but from experience I can tell you it's easy to
despise what you do get as well, especially in terms of cable channels.
I was going to be skeptical of the idea of a fox eating grapes in the
first place, but apparently they're omnivores so that checks out. Still,
it would have been slightly more reasonable to have the fox chasing after
a vole or something, and then the English language would contain the phrase
"Oh, that's just sour voles." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Tortoise and the Hare</SPAN><BR>
"Slow but steady wins the race." This is untrue. Generally speaking, slow
but steady loses the race rather humiliatingly. Slow but steady wins the
pie-eating contest. The story is amusing enough, but the moral should be
changed to "Slow but steady wins the race if all the other participants
are narcoleptics," or alternatively "Don't be a moron." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mice and the Weasels</SPAN><BR>
You probably don't know this one. In brief, a bunch of mice appoint
mouse generals in their war with the weasels. The mouse generals wear
elaborate hats and get eaten because in the inevitable retreat they
can't fit back in the mouse holes. In spite of what Aesop would have
you believe, this has absolutely no application to life in general,
but I still like it because it's about weasels. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The North Wind and the Sun</SPAN><BR>
This is a little obscure, but you've probably heard it. The North Wind
and the Sun have a little contest to see who can make a random passerby
get naked, which is remarkably similar to a game I played in college. The
North Wind can't blow the guy's clothes off, but the Sun persuades him
to take his clothes off by buying him beers and telling him he looks
like Julia Roberts. Or something like that. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</SPAN><BR>
Hey, what a handy little fable. At long last we have a useful lesson:
don't judge by appearances, and an interesting little story with a
violent ending and everything. Not that it's easy to picture a wolf
being at all convincing with a sheep skin thrown over its shoulders, but  
it's also hard to imagine George Clooney as an avenging crimefighter, so
every era has its problems. <B>A</B></P>

like goatees might just keep getting more and more valuable. We dared
to hope that perhaps the Goatee Economy would transform society, but I
think in our hearts we knew that it couldn't last. And yet, many of us
hung on to our goatees even as plunging goatee values made headlines
across the world. And even now there are pockets of us stubbornly
clinging to our goatees both in the literal and metaphorical sense,
those who insist that it was never about the money and the parties and
being interviewed by news-magazines as if our opinions mattered. It was,

I've kept chickens; I once had a pair of hens named "Hazel" and
"Foxglove" after two characters from the Sandman comic, which 
will probably come back to haunt me if I ever run for public
office. Anyhow, two chickens is too many, given that together they
produced over 600 eggs a year. Even the most cholesterol-stuffed
egg-sucking maniac doesn't eat half that many. They were cute, though,
if not the brightest vertebrates in the ecosphere. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sheep</SPAN><BR>
The thing about sheep is that they provide us with many important
metaphors: being led like sheep, the Lamb of God, taking a long
walk off a short sheep, &c. Wool and mutton I can live without, but
the use of sheep as a literary device is indispensable. Plus they
give border collies something to do. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pigs</SPAN><BR>
Why is it that pigs are always the ones to get rescued from the
slaughterhouse in kids' movies? There are other food animals, you
know. Why didn't Charlotte write "Some Domestic Bison" in her
web? Why didn't we see a dark-toned sequel called "Babe: Rock
Cornish Game Hen in the City"? Pigs are cute and all -- for the first
six months of their life before they become hulking beasts -- but
let's widen the field a bit, shall we? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Geese</SPAN><BR>
Geese, I'm led to understand, make excellent watchdogs. Which is good
because Rottweillers make lousy poultry. But whereas a watchdog will
be sweet and loyal to its owner, geese are ill-tempered and loud towards
all and sundry. If "Chicken Little" were at all based in reality,
Goosey-Loosey would have just swatted C.L. on the beak and then honked 
loudly for fifteen minutes. <B>D</B></P>

Fun! Often painful! Here's an interesting bit of psychology: when a

spell out words in light, what does he or she write? "USA"? "We hold
these truths to be self-evident"? Good gosh, no! What gets emblazoned
on the mosquito-infested air is the name of the tyke in question. Lesson
to be learned: even nation-wide celebrations can be all about you

The quintessence of personal pyrotechnics. They whistle, they shoot through the

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Firecrackers</SPAN><BR>
Aside from being an excellent way for impish moppets in depression-era

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Black Snakes</SPAN><BR>
Are these fireworks?  How did they end up in my fireworks assortment?
You light them, they glow silently, they leave a substance behind.
By that standard, a pack of menthols constitutes fireworks. Presumably
these are for the introspective portion of the evening, when you've decided
to eat that last unidentifiable piece of fried chicken and light the last

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sloop John B</SPAN><BR>
Best known as a Beach Boys Song, that doesn't change the fact
that this sea chanty belongs to the masses. I credit its
enduring popularity to its timeless themes. Who of us hasn't 
gone on an ill-considered sea trip where the cook got the fits
and ate up all of our corn? It's that sort of common touch
on the part of the Beach Boys that almost makes up for "Kokomo." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Aura Lee</SPAN><BR>
More fun with pop music: this bit of folkery provided the melody
for the Elvis song "Love Me Tender." It would be fun to find out
that all of Elvis's music was based on folk songs, and that for
instance "In the Ghetto" was based on an old Irish tune called
"Molly O'Branaghan's Knickers" or somesuch, but such is not to be.
At any rate, Elvis's version was actually an improvement on the
original, which was an interminable ode to a blackbird singing
Aura Lee's name and how lovely she is and how lovely the day is and 
how lovely the bird is and did I mention she's blonde? Yawn. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lord Randall</SPAN><BR>
A great folk song in the grand tradition of gory violence, 
long set-ups, and dropped vowels, this tells the story of
young Lord Randall, who ate poisoned eels and died. It's
better than it sounds. The longer version has Randy explaining
the particulars of his will from his deathbed, with the
unsurprising denouement that the woman who poisoned him gets
bupkiss. No, really, it's much better than it sounds. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Barbara Allen</SPAN><BR>
Not much of a plot to this one, really. Some guy dies because he
loves Barbara Allen, and Barbara Allen dies because the guy died.
And then plants grow out of their grave. Huh. One thing I noticed in
common with this and "Lord Randall" is that the soon-to-snuff-it 
protagonists both insist on having their beds made for them. I feel
sorry for the bed-makers because, you know, they're going to have
to wash the sheets again afterwards anyway. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Arkansas Traveler</SPAN><BR>
This is a perfectly reasonable song about how wonderful it is to be
in Arkansas -- not a sentiment I'm inclined to share, but I'm sure
Arkansanians like it just fine. Now, however, it's known almost universally as
"The Baby Bumblebee Song" thanks to Bugs Bunny cartoons. Looney Tunes were
really good at that, invading and taking over songs like this as well as
more classical fare like Wagner's "Kill The Wabbit Theme" and Rossini's
"Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro
Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro." <B>C-</B></P>

My favorite part of the game is when the announcers make
all these circles and lines on the screen the better to illustrate
their subtle and intricate point that the two teams are attempting
to move in opposite directions. My big thought this week is that all
TVs should come with built-in magic pencil attachments, to that
you can provide your own running commentary on TV shows. "Okay,
Jerry [draws a circle] is going to try for the mouse hole

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Beer Commercials</SPAN><BR> 
You'll notice that beer commercials --
those not featuring lizards and bikini girls -- often show the whirling

them. Do you know why? Because hops are <EM>flowers.</EM> The advertisers
know that if the Joe Six-Packs and Ed Pony-Kegs of the nation

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Army Boots</SPAN><BR>
"Your mother wears army boots" is no longer the insult it used
to be, owing to the increasing acceptance of functional footwear
for both sexes. In an ideal world, this insult would be replaced by
"Your mother wears stiletto heels which impede mobility, destroy
arch support and are an unflattering shade of red." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tennis Shoes </SPAN><BR>
The airsoles and the flashing lights and the celebrity
endorsements are what get all the attention, but what impresses me
most about them is the vast improvements in tread design we've
seen over the past couple of decades. Tennis shoe treads now
incorporate all sorts of freaky expressionist art. If only the

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flip-Flops</SPAN><BR>
Also known as zories, wedgies, jellies, thongs and Jerusalem
crickets, these have the advantage that they're easy to slip

that they're designed only for walking in one direction at a 
moderate pace. Try and pull of a mambo in these things and they'll
be called "soaring projectiles." <B>B-</B></P>

At six-foot-four I'd no sooner wear platform shoes than an artificial

on hanging decorations in festive Mexican restaurants. Then you can
see what it's like to have everyone assume that if there's something

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Crosswords for Dummies</SPAN><BR>
This whole "for dummies" thing started because some people are intimidated by computers, and need reassurance that a book on Windows isn't going to assume that they already knew terms like "TCP/IP" and "keyboard." While those of us who know our asses from our asyncronous transfer protocols like to laugh at them, the fact is that most people who know a lot about computers can't talk about them without putting out more attitude than a rap star. So there's a legitimate need there. Having said that: crosswords?

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wine for Dummies</SPAN><BR>
Not knowing much about wine is one of the benefits of being a dummy, should you ask me.  It allows you to spend three bucks on a bottle of wine with a cartoon character on the label and not realize there's anything wrong with it until it turns your urine green. I imagine people who buy this have wine snob friends they want to impress, in which case Chapter One should be titled "Good Places To Hide This Book." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dachsunds for Dummies</SPAN><BR>
This is probably my favorite "For Dummies" book, but mostly because it sounds like a children's book, kind of a cross between "The Stupids" and "Bread and Jam for Frances."

<p class="ratingheader">Myomancy</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
Myomancy is the ancient tradition of predicting the future by watching what mice do. There are various approaches to this. My favorite involves setting a mouse free and watching to see how it makes its exit. I wish that was my job. Heads of state and influential members of the community come to the steps of my temple, asking me for guidance. I listen to them with solemn visage, nodding in empathy. Then I go set a mouse free. Run, mousie! That's job satisfaction. Another option is just to assume that mice know something we don't. This is remarkably effective. For instance, very few mice bought an Xbox when they first came out. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Tarot</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
The wonderful thing about tarot is that people have pasted nearly every theme you can imagine onto the archetypes, ranging from Arthurian mythos to anthropomorphic ducks, and covering all the popular religions and many trademarked characters in the process. Tarot decks are like lunchboxes for new-agers. I was sincerely surprised to find out there's no Dukes of Hazzard Tarot. <span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Moleoscopy</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
There's got to be a better name than this. "Moleoscopy" sounds like an uncomfortable medical procedure that could probably double as a fraternity initiation. In reality, it's the practice of divining your character and future from the location and pattern of moles on your body. Presumably the auguries are somewhat more specific than "You really ought to have that looked at. Did you get sunburned a lot as a kid?" I can't help but see this method of fortunetelling as kind of invasive. It makes feeling the bumps on your head look like business correspondence by comparison. I can only hope that nobody has hit upon the idea of divination by means of sphincter creases. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Oneiromancy</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
You know what's dumb? Those "dream dictionaries." Jung or no Jung, I refuse to believe that a short stack of banana pancakes means the same thing in my dreams as it does in every other person's dream. I have a very idiosyncratic relationship with banana pancakes. The other side of oneiromancy--fortunetelling through dream analysis--is the standard bowing-wheat sort of prophecy. Frankly, if my dreams are prophesies, then Kurt Loder and my first-grade teacher have a larger role to play in future events than one could reasonably expect. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Clairvoyance</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
This cuts through all the messing about with animal parts and gaming accessories and gets down to the basics: you see the future because the future is the sort of thing you see. This is a popular form of prophecy among the supermarket tabloid set, because the modern consensus is that sitting in an easy chair and rubbing your temple is a plausible way of predicting future events, but staring at tea leaves is just silly. Personally, I'm more of a fan of the divinatory dog and prophetic pony show because then no matter what your stance on actual fortunetelling, at least you get incense and a show. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Numerology</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
Numerology is problematical for me, because I've had about fifteen different names in my lifetime, taking into account different spellings and arrangements of middle names. According to numerology at this point I should either be ruling a small Eastern European country with an iron fist or crushed under the wheels of some marketing executive's Beemer. Or, with certain spellings, both. I'm also not sure of the numerological value of an umlaut, which may be what's messing everything up. I don't need this. I have enough of this sort of trouble deciding on a cellular phone plan. Ooh, hey: Motorolamancy! The practice of telling your future from the quality of your phone reception. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Bibliomancy</p>

<p class="ratingbody">This is telling your fortune by opening a book and reading a line
at random.  The key here is choosing the right book. I tried it with
<cite>Hop on Pop</cite> and my fortune is apparently "Eat a snack." 
Eerily accurate, if not precisely earth-shaking. Bad books for
bibliomancy include <cite>Carrie</cite>, <cite>Left Behind</cite>, and
the collected works of Hunter S. Thompson. Good books include <cite>The
Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love</cite>, most Nancy Drew mysteries, and
any cookbook. ("There are two cups of cake flour in my future!") <cite>Pat
the Bunny</cite> is also nice if you like soothing augury.<span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Pyromancy</p>

<p class="ratingbody">Really, fire is good for anything. Defense, education, waste disposal.
Burning things. Creating things which are burnt. And, according
to pyromancy, it's good for telling the future. The simplest form
of pyromancy involves staring at the coals and seeing what the
shapes look like. I don't mean to be a doubting doubter, but my
future appears to involve mostly horsies and duckies. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Crystallography</p>

<p class="ratingbody">This is your classic crystal-ball-into-looking. My copy of <cite>The
Little Giant Encyclopedia of Fortune Telling</cite> lays down
a bunch of rules for crystal ball care: "Only you should handle your
crystal ball." "Do not allow direct sunlight to fall on the crystal
ball." "Wash the crystal ball using vinegar and water." Is it just
me or are these just transcribed instructions for vaginal hygiene
circa 1953?<span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Necromancy</p>

<p class="ratingbody">Necromancy, to me, means raising an army of undead to strike fear
into the hearts of tunic-wearing villagers, but apparently simply chatting
with dead people counts too. The most popular home necromancy
kit is of course the Ouija board. Even more amusing to me than
the fact that you can buy necromancy at Kay-Bee Toys is the
fact that it's labeled "for ages 8 and up." Because seven is
just a bit too young to be communing with the dead.<span class="ratinggrade">A-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Cromniomancy</p>

<p class="ratingbody">So you come up with a question, then write possible answers to
that question ("Eric," "Tom," "Kill Them All") on individual 
onions. The first to sprout is the correct answer. It's like
a biological cootie catcher. The problem here is the time investment.
The very fact that you're trying to tell the future implies a 
certain degree of impatience, doesn't it? If you're going to
have to wait for your answer you may as well be using chronomancy,
the art of telling the future by waiting to see what happens.<span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Graphology</p>

<p class="ratingbody">There's a lot of controversy over the scientific validity of 
handwriting analysis as a personality indicator. My feeling
is that there are some times when it's definitely applicable.
For instance, if someone writes their capital "I" with a large
loop and in human blood, they're probably somewhat unbalanced.
If the "I" is used in the sentence "I am glad the DVD for
<cite>Glitter</cite> has director's commentary," then definitely so.<span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

With the magnetic pizza ad holding up the pizza coupons on the fridge which holds cold pizza next to the pile of pizza boxes, you can get a nice little pizza motif going in your kitchen.

Flying cars and the future are synonymous. That's how we know it's not the future yet: there are no flying cars in mass production.

disappointing. Instead of blasting the heads of mucus-filled aliens,
we're correcting vision, pointing to things in office presentations,

You'd think that after creating human-like intelligence from silicon and electricity, turning down the reverb would be a no-brainer, but science is weird that way. At any rate, household robots will come in three models: monotone, sassy, and British. I'd go with British. Monotone will probably kill things. <B>B-</B></P></TD>

I'm not sure what social advantage this serves, especially considering the food pills and household robots, but I think it's somehow related to men of the future adopting hats and pipes. <B>D</B></P></TD>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cartoon Tag</SPAN><BR>
This schoolyard biathlon, requiring both physical agility and
encyclopedic knowledge of international animation. Although, to
be perfectly honest, if you had one you didn't need the other.
I wasn't the greatest runner, but I could avoid being "it"
for hours on end using the "Thundercats" alone. Which is good,
because this is a frustrating game in which to be "it." There's
nothing more maddening than having your quarry almost within
your clutches, only to have "Casper the Friendly Ghost" shouted
in your face. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dodge Ball</SPAN><BR>
Also known as "The Welt Game." Whoever came up with the idea of a game 
where the goal is to cream someone with a ball had both a keen insight
into child psychology and a clear interest in keeping school nurses
employed. Did you know that the common yardball is capable of being thrown
up to 416 miles per hour? <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tetherball</SPAN><BR>
I found, on the Web, a reference to an "Official Size and Weight"
tetherball for sale. I'm really interested in the standards 
body that oversees this. Is it a strictly American 
organization, or is it an international consortium? Do they
convene every few years to review advances in tetherball technology?
Are there heated arguments over who gets to go first, clockwise
or counter-clockwise? Maybe we should have an
"Autumn Olympics" with games like tetherball, mini-golf, and
bowling. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Red Rover</SPAN><BR>
Probably the sophomore effort by the inventor of Dodge Ball. "In
<EM>this</EM> game, you throw yourself full-tilt at a line of other
unprotected grade-schoolers. No extra points for broken limbs." The
chant is unnerving, though. It sounds like the mumbling of a 
mentally disturbed machete aficionado sneaking up on the
teenage victim in a horror film. "Red rover...red rover...let...
Jenny...come over!" Screech, whack, fade to black. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Duck Duck Goose</SPAN><BR>
Hoo-ha, now this was a game. Suspense! Action! The Mush Pot! 
This game had it all. Plus, and this was the real bonus, you
got to spend most of the game sitting down. Heck, if you
were in the Mush Pot, you didn't even have to <EM>worry</EM>
about having to leap up at any moment. You could just sit back,
covered in gentle, soothing metaphorical mush, and enjoy
the relaxing chant of "Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck..." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">King Ghidora</SPAN><BR>
For sheer entertainment, you can't beat a monster with three heads.
Two heads are fun and all, but add that third head and you're talking
Oscar material, if only in the sense that I know a guy named Oscar
who digs on it. However, filmmaking techniques of the time had no 
method of adequately controlling three rubbery giant monster heads,
so they pretty much just bob around and shoot lightning
breath whenever one is pointed more or less in the right 
direction. Even for a series of movies where "special effects magic"
is defined as "not being able to see the wires too much," it's
pretty lame. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mothra</SPAN><BR>
Mothra has a lot going for him in both his "disgusting larvae"
and "marginally less disgusting adult" forms -- pollen blasts,
spooge rays, eyes that are apparently made of some sort of golf ball --
but the real selling point is his entourage. Mothra's personal
affairs are handled by a pair of identical pixies in funky
thrift-store garb who break into song with disturbing regularity.
This is never adequately explained: giant moth, miniature women,
attractive carrying case, shut up and watch the movie. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rodan</SPAN><BR>
Advantage: French sculptor puns. Disadvantage: No arms, no teeth,
no breath rays, just big flappy wings. The whole reason for
watching Godzilla movies is to see things a) stomped, and b) blown up
with breath rays, so watching roof tiles fly off pagodas is a
little disappointing by comparison. He eventually developed fire
breath in 1993, but by then we'd had such science fiction classics
as "The Last Starfighter" and "Dreamscape," so it was really too little
too late. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mechagodzilla</SPAN><BR>
This is one tricked-out honey of a mechanical lizard, and that's not
praise I hand out often. So many beams and rockets! Even his feet fire
rockets! Many people overlook the potential of feet when building giant
robots, but not the makers of Mechagodzilla.  Another nice thing is that
his builders even went so far as to give him spine-spikes just like the
atomic monster he's modeled after. That's something I admire in alien
overlords bent on the subjugation of our planet: attention to detail. 
<B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Little Plastic Tanks</SPAN><BR>
In spite of the fact that tanks have repeatedly been shown
to have no more effect on Godzilla than a shampoo and creme 
rinse, they still get trotted out with every new monster
attack, rolling shakily over the canvas landscape and
firing their little sparklers. The reason for this, I'm guessing,
is political. If the prime minister fails to send the tanks,
in the next election his opponent will run ads saying
"In the last Godzilla attack, the incumbent failed to send
out the fakey-looking plastic tanks to protect us. My opponent
is obviously <EM>soft on giant monsters!</EM>" <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Horseshoe</SPAN><BR>
Sure, why not. There's probably some goddess-crescent connection here,
and if there isn't I'm sure there are plenty of liberal arts undergrads
willing to make one up. My favorite part is how you're supposed to
keep your lucky horseshoe's ends up "to keep the luck from pouring out."
Because you don't want to have a doorstep covered in luck which will enter the
sewage system during the next rain and drain to the ocean, resulting in
unnaturally fortunate salmon.  The resulting devastating impact on the
ecosystem is easy to envision. So watch it. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rabbit Foot</SPAN><BR>
Yeah yeah, it wasn't lucky for the rabbit, we've all heard that one
about a million times, and the only reason I even mention it is to 
avoid mail "reminding" me of this "oversight." Even so, I find
rabbit's feet a little gruesome to pin my personal fortunes to.
I don't want to be put in the position of saying "I owe all my success
and acclaim to this dismembered mammal limb I keep with me." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shooting Star</SPAN><BR>
That's right, an isolated chunk of interstellar grit traversed uncounted
miles of cold space, then fell into the sea of our atmosphere and died
in a slashing trail of flame so that you could wish for a new
set of speakers for your Chevy Tahoe. I mean, astrology also assumes
heavenly objects determine whether it's a good time to buy a new shirt,
but at least astrology doesn't require Venus to crash into the earth for
to do so. On the other hand, shooting stars are pretty. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lucky Penny</SPAN><BR>
"FInd a penny, pick it up, and all the day you'll have good luck." Does
this apply to convenience store penny trays? You possess the penny
for an instant before handing it to the clerk, don't you? You found it,
you picked it up. My God, this could revolutionize the science of
random prosperity. It could take its place among other examples of
modern luck-generation innovations like the steam-powered wishing well
and Rainbow Brite. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Four-Leaf Clover</SPAN><BR>
I imagine most good luck charms have an annoying song associated with
them if you look hard enough (e.g. "Lucky Star") but this one is just out
of control. I don't know if it was the traditional Sing Along with Mitch
version or the gory schoolyard parody that made it impossible for me to
consider clover of any variety -- even clover honey -- without hearing
"...that I overlooked beFORE!" echoing insanely through my head, but I
don't like it. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><B>Cool</B><BR>
It's interesting that the word "cool" has survived so long as a slang
term in a world where MTV introduces a new expression of exuberance
every three days.  (The latest: "That's so elkhound!") Not only that,
it has essentially the same meaning it's always had: laid-back,
unruffled, and free of visible signs of venereal disease. <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Bad</B><BR>
Boy, people loved this one.  It was an easy way for eighties sitcoms
to fill space between commercials for Super Nintendo: have the hip,
wisecracking, bandana-wearing ethnic youngster explain to the befuddled
father figure that "bad" means "good"! Such hilarity! Whee! This one
lost favor when it became associated with Michael Jackson in skintight
bondage gear. Just like Macaulay Culkin did. <B>D</B></P>

<P><B>Phat</B><BR>
Do the street toughs supposedly responsible for recent slang really care
all that much about whimsical spelling? I can't help but suspect that the
"ph"--if not the whole deal--was dreamed up by the same slick-haired
record exec who gave us Kris Kross. <B>C</B></P>

<P><B>Awesome</B><BR>
This one stopped being used by actual youths about 1991, but for some
reason it's stuck in the heads of ad writers, who use it to describe
anything from the latest Pokemon movie to blue frosting.  For fun,
mentally substitute the original meaning of the word: "New Tropical Berry
Blast instills one with a sense of awe!" <B>C-</B></P>

<P><B>Gear</B><BR>
"Fab" was also nice, but I like "gear" because it's so inexplicable.
"Gear"? As in "We can't get on the freeway because my Honda won't go
past second..."? For maximum effect, this word <em>must</em> be pronounced with
a bad Liverpudlian accent. <B>B</B></P>

Ah, yes, Gaia, the warm, loving earth mother who made a <EM>sickle</EM>
so one of her <EM>sons</EM> could <EM>castrate another</EM> one of
her sons, who also happened to be <EM>his brother</EM> and <EM>her

were monsters, hundred-handed giants and the like, makes hers a story
more likely to go over well at a David Lynch film festival than a
solstice retreat/drum circle. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Zeus</SPAN><BR>
Zeus became the head god by dint of not being eaten by his father.
Consider that a sort of eighth habit of highly effective people:
very few of those in positions of power and authority were devoured
at birth. Zeus released his previously-swallowed siblings and defeated his,
became ruler of the sky and land, and in turn 
devoured his first wife Metis for fear of being overthrown by 
his own children. A lot of this goes on in Greek mythology; it's like
those Looney Tunes in which Sylvester swallows Tweety Bird and
Tweety goes on to have a long conversation with whomever else Sylvester
had eaten that day. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ares</SPAN><BR>
I was hoping to blow the lid off the perennial representation of
Ares as a bloodthirsty jerk of a god, but a little research shows
that, nope, he's a jerk. And a bloodthirsty one at that. If you want
Ares to get his due, you have to skip over to the Romans, who loved
this guy. They called him Mars and talked about how noble it was
to get the smackdown in his name. But the Greeks, being more interested
in olive oil and hypotenuses than world conquest, wanted little to do with
him. Good for them. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Aphrodite</SPAN><BR>
Aphrodite was the god of love, desire, and if you watch Xena,
peroxide. She arose from the sea after the severed
genitals of Uranus were discarded there. I just want to point out that
I'm not looking for the particularly gruesome bits from Greek mythology.
You can't read two pages through a book of Greek myths without running
into severed genitals, baby-eating, vomit, sex with animals,
liver-extraction, and similar horrors. It's like Bullfinch meets Troma.
Anyhow. Aphrodite had a magical girdle. Good for her. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dionysus</SPAN><BR>
I'm not going to go into how Dionysus was born. Suffice to say
it fits right in with the other godly birth stories and involves
Zeus' thigh. At any rate, Dionysus attracted a cult following of women
who drank a lot and went into periodic fits of utter madness, which
is pretty much what I'm trying to do with this Web page. It's too
late for me to be raised by mountain nymphs as he was, but I do
what I can with what I have. It was the feasts of Dionysus that inspired
the early Greeks to invent theatre, so you could say that in a roundabout
way Dionysus is responsible for the whole folderol surrounding 
"The Phantom Menace." Good for him. <B>A</B>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mini Candy Bars</SPAN><BR>
The reigning czar of empty calories, "fun-size" (apparently fun is
about an inch square) candy
bars are highly processed, excitingly packaged, and about the
only way to get halfway decent chocolate (as opposed to, say,
Tootsie Rolls) in your Halloween pillowcase. I completely dig on
these, even the crappy little Mr. Goodbars, and even today when
I give into tradition and hand out goods to urchins instead of going
and catching a movie, these are the treats I buy, mostly for the
leftover value. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bit O' Honey</SPAN><BR>
What is this? Is this candy? As I remember, each year I gave 
these the old elementary school try, only to be
convinced anew that they were the product of the twisted
mind of a mad confectioner. "I've done it!" I can see him
screaming to the empty walls. "I've combined the
unsettlingly wholesome flavor of honey with the inedibility
of old bus-seat gum! And they called me seriously unbalanced
and in need of a competent therapist! <EM>Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!</EM>"
Bleah. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lollipops</SPAN><BR>
Mmmm. Time-release sugar. High on sucrose and vibrating at 450 Kilohertz,
suckers were a great way to keep the party rotating. And such festive
colors! Such intense flavors! It was like freebasing Kool-Aid. Even
today I occasionally get a jones for artificial grape flavor that would 
not be believed. It puts one
in the mind of a Saturday morning cartoon version of "Trainspotting."
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bubble Gum</SPAN><BR>
Each year, perhaps the surest sign that the hedonistic sugar frenzy was
coming to an end was when I gave up and started chewing the
gum. The candy bars were a distant memory, the suckers had
been reduced to damp sticks, and even the Smarties had
been poured down my throat like so many Smurf vertebrae, 
and I set to the task of chewing the piles of organ-pink
Double Bubble and Bazooka Joe, more out of a sense of duty
than actual desire. Such are the trials of childhood. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Toothbrushes</SPAN><BR>
Oh, hardy har har. One wag on the block always figured Halloween 
for a good time to spread an important message about dental hygiene.
Like we didn't have toothbrushes at home. Granted, a shiny new
toothbrush <EM>is</EM> kind of nifty, but it's the principle of the
thing, dammit. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jujyfruits</SPAN><BR>
These are basically little cavity factories. They enter your mouth,
they latch onto your teeth and they do <em>not let go.</em> I think
I still have Jujyfruit attached to my back molars from the last
time I ate them, which I believe was the 1989 Spike and Mike
animation festival. They were out of red vines. In addition, they
insist on adding licorice and mint to the otherwise palatable
selection. And finally, they're shaped like, what? Corn? Asparagus?
Eggplant? Spleens? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Flintstones</SPAN><BR>
 Portions of my brain are dedicated to
storing -- and periodically retrieving with no warning -- the theme
song from The Flintstones. A really  <EM>good</EM> section, too. I've
occasionally forgotten my own phone number, my social security number, my
proper place in civilized society. But not for one picosecond have I been
able to forget that I will, with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo
time, whatever that is. I can't help but think that this brainspace
would have been better used memorizing the rare earth metals section of
the Periodic Table (Atomic Numbers 58-71 and 90-103) or the names of all
of Charlie's Angels (Kelly, Sabrina, Jill, Kris, Tiffany, and Julie). As
for the show itself, well, a record player that uses a bird's beak as the
stylus is only funny the first couple dozen times, you know? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Challenge of the Gobots</SPAN><BR>
 Playing Herman's Hermits to
the Transformers' Beatles wouldn't have been a fun job under the best of
circumstances, but this show added insult to ignominity. It featured one
of the most pestilential aspects of modern Saturday Morning Cartoondom:
Frank Welker's Squeaky Voice.</P>

<P>Don't get me wrong. Frank Welker is a very talented man -- he's provided
voices for everyone from Inspector Gadget's Doctor Claw to the Simpsons'
Santa's Little Helper. But he has this one voice, his Squeaky Voice, that
makes me want to smash the TV and slit my wrists with the shards. It's the
voice of "Slimer" from "The Real Ghostbusters." It's the voice of "Uni"
from the old "Dungeons and Dragons" series ("Baaaaaaa-Beeeeee!"). And
it's the voice of Scooter from "Challenge of the Gobots."</P>

<P>Oddly enough, Welker also played gobs of Transformers. But they
weren't <EM>squeaky</EM> Transformers. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hong Kong Phooey</SPAN><BR>
 How could this <EM>not</EM> be
great? It combined cartoon animals, superheroics, and martial arts,
an accomplishment unmatched until the Turtles choked the life out of
the action figure scene a decade or two later. The Ninja Teens, however,
did not feature the voice of Scatman Crothers, more's the pity. Teenage
Mutant Scat-Singing Turtles would have been quite a sight to behold. At
any rate, Hong Kong Phooey was cool. He kicked things. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wacky Races</SPAN><BR>
That's what I would have called
it, too. Pretty much everything Dick Dastardly and Muttley were
in (c.f. "Dastardly and Muttley and their Flying Machines" and
"Laff-A-Lympics, The") was cool, and they were pretty much the central
figures of this one. Sure, there were some standard cartoon archetypes
racing alongside them, but aside from Penelope Pitstop and her really
very odd lip-mobile, they were individually forgettable. But as a whole,
they provided a nice backdrop against which Dick and Muttley could be
nefarious. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Jetsons</SPAN><BR>
 This lacks what limited appeal it once had,
given that the original joke was basically "Wow, what wacky things
they'll have in the future," and now we have stuff in the Sharper Image
catalog that makes The Jetsons look like a frontier museum. Oh, sure,
we don't have personal air cars or household robots that sass back,
but did George Jetson have Power Flow Insoles or a Bedside White Noise
Generator? You see my point. <B>D+</B></P>

seem to be irascible, hard-nosed bookkeepers and/or bookies, and
I think that would be good for me sometimes. Although, now that
I think of it, maybe it's the black straps on their upper arms.
Or both; having your blood circulation cut off by little black
tourniquets while a green visor makes the world look like a thrift-store
TV set from the seventies would make anyone irascible. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Beanies</SPAN><BR>
I've always liked beanies, but then I've always thought Jughead
was a stylin' guy. I'm sure one of these days wearing a beanie
and walking around with your eyes closed will come back into
fashion and I'll be vindicated. I'll just have to put on my own
beanie and close my own eyes. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fedoras</SPAN><BR>
For some reason, and I don't claim to understand this, there's
a general semiconscious desire running throughout geekdom to see
the men's hat make a comeback. This is hampered by two facts. First,
anything coveted by geeks is unlikely to become a popular accessory
unless it keeps track of phone numbers, and second, all the good
hats have been taken by fictional characters. Before Raiders of the Lost
Ark, a fedora was just mildly eccentric. Now it's just this side of
wearing a Vader mask. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chef Hats</SPAN><BR>
The chef hat seems to be going out of style. The only TV chefs that
wear them are the Iron Chefs, and even they take them off when it's
time to get down to stirring, braising, and gutting live fish. This
is unfortunate not only because it further lowers the status of the
venerable chef hat, but because it makes them look even more like members
of a Japanese version of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fezzes</SPAN><BR>
In some counties, the fez is considered a perfectly reasonable piece
of headwear. In the US, however, it's associated with middle-aged men
and tiny novelty cars, the sort of thing one of the Village People would
wear if they were a polka band. The really interesting thing is
that the fez has managed to remain a symbol of something only the
previous generation would wear for decades, meaning that
either the lure of the fez becomes irresistible once you hit forty,
or Shriners are immortal. Neither option is comforting. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">He-Man</SPAN><BR>
An incredibly muscular blond guy in a breechcloth and
a page boy. On this planet he'd be stripping for tips
in North Beach, but on Eternia he fights deformed animal guys
and delivers homilies on the value of cooperation. Location,
location, location. My real difficulty with He-Man is that
his secret identity -- "Prince Adam," which is a porn name
if I ever heard one -- was nothing more than 
a change of outfit and a whiny voice.
He didn't even bother with the Clark Kent eyeglass move, for
God's sake. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Skeletor</SPAN><BR>
I can only imagine the incredible amounts of money Mattel must
have saved by not allowing the action figure designers to
spend more than thirty-five seconds coming up with character
names. Skeletor was a by-the-book evil overlord, from his raspy
voice to his megalomania to his incompetent flunkies. While
the ram's head staff was a nice Satanic touch, he really didn't
add anything to the genre. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Man-At-Arms</SPAN><BR>
One of the neighborhood kids --  when I was young and actually playing
with action figures, as opposed to just having them -- was convinced
that the name "Man-At-Arms" was composed of the first name "Man-At"
and the last name "Arms." As if he was the child of Hank and
Brenda Arms, an art-loving couple who tried to name their son
after Manet but missed by a vowel. Still, considering that the
character's real first name was "Duncan," my friend's delusion was
a marked improvement. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mer-Man</SPAN><BR>
The moral schema of Eternia was pretty straightforward: "Incredibly
Ugly = Evil, Merely Grotesque = Good." Mer-Man, in spite of the 
handsome-sea-lord invoking name, was squarely on the malformed
misanthrope side of things. He was a fish guy and a lackey of
Skeletor's. He may have had some sort of fish powers, I don't know,
but his main tasks were to do Skeletor's dirty work, and to run like
a startled chinchilla when confronted by He-Man, thereby preserving
the cartoon's oddly non-violent facade. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Orko</SPAN><BR>
Don't talk to me about Orko. I don't want to hear it. The
very existence of Orko in cartoon-land has serious impact
on my will to live. When did they pass the Constitutional Amendment
requiring squeaky-voiced buffoon sidekicks in kids' cartoons?
The only things between Orko and Scrappy-Doo level badness
are his lack of a moronic battle cry, and the fact that the
He-Man show would have sucked even without him. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stinkor</SPAN><BR>
You have to admire the design chutzpah that went into
creating this molded plastic marriage of action-packed fun and unpleasant
odor. When you make something like this, you're hoping that
kids will be so enamored of the very awfulness
of it that they will overcome a parent's natural reluctance to
spend seven bucks on something where the main selling point
is "smells bad." Apparently the gamble paid off, though, because
it seemed like half the kids on my block had one of these guys. <B>B</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Twinkies</B></BIG><BR> The quintessential Hostess 
food, similar to foods you might create in your own kitchen, 
but profoundly different. Yes, the outer coating bears a 
passing resemblance to sponge cake, and the "creamy 
filling" might have once read a book about a dairy product, 
but overall it has that quality of taste and texture that can only 
be found on the snack food aisle. <B>A+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Cupcakes</B></BIG><BR> These are odd. What is it with 
the so-called frosting? It's this weird flat tortilla of sugar and 
chocolate clinging pathetically to the much larger cake unit. 
The best theory I've heard is that the cake and frosting of a 
Hostess cupcake are actually the male and female versions of 
the same organism. This would mean that the little swirl of 
white frosting on top is actually genetic material, which let's 
face it is what it resembles in the first place. 
<B>B+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Chocodiles</B></BIG><BR> A rebel Twinkie. The 
Chocodile rejects the hypocritical sociability of the other 
Twinkies in their happy little packs of three, wrapped in 
plastic and denial, and instead chooses to go it alone, sitting 
in its chocolatey leather jacket and brooding about the futility 
of existence. But they're hard to find and really not as tasty, 
so they get a <B>B.</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Fruit Pies</B></BIG><BR> Hostess is the reigning 
monarch of hand-held pies. You can keep your Dolly 
Madison, your Home Run pies, your miniature pecan pie 
gas station desserts: give me a cherry Hostess fruit pie and a 
place to eat it and I shall gain some weight. Other 
manufacturers skimp on the fruit filling, the shortening for 
the crust, the festive artificial coloring, but not Hostess. 
Truly the luxury model. <B>A</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Suzy Q</B></BIG><BR> What is the point? Do we really 
need a Hostess product where you can see the "creamy 
filling" before you even open the package? The end result is 
that a thick layer of the dessert in question remains attached 
to the wrapper, not to mention the fact that the filling is free 
to squeege out all over your fingers if you're not careful. 
Not the sort of snack food I want my children exposed to. 
<B>C-</B></P>
 
<P>Unfortunately I have reached an impasse on perhaps the 
most controversial issue of our time. To wit: which are better, 
<B>Ding-Dongs</B> or <B>Ho-Hos</B>?
Blood is shed daily on the streets of some of 
our more pathetic cities over this very question, and I have a 
friend who has promised to personally whack me with a 
titanium microphone stand if I come out on the wrong side, 
although I've forgotten which she prefers. Well, what the 
hell, let's say serve Ho-Hos with red meat and Ding-Dongs 
with fish and give them both an <B>A.</B> </P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Muffin Loaf</SPAN><BR>
I'm not sure what distinguishes a "muffin loaf" from "bread," or
alternatively "cake." Probably the rising sun on the package, which 
is the Hostess ideogram for "eat this at breakfast, sugar-slave."
Anyhow, this artificially fruit-flavored food brick
has the same chemical mouth-feel as the rest of the Hostess gang,
only sans filling and frosting. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosted Donettes</SPAN><BR>
Leaving aside the fact that the word "Donette" would logically
indicate a miniature Don, you have to admire the way Hostess
extends the shelf life of these little bakery knobs by
sending them out of the factory with the same taste and texture 
one would expect from stale doughnuts. Add to that the fact
that the sell-by date doesn't have a visible year,
and you have the ultimate chocolate-swaddled mystery snack. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sno-Balls</SPAN><BR>
These are just plain weird. Even the ones that <EM>aren't</EM> dyed
green are weird. When you observe other attempts to arrange a
common-law marriage of marshmallow and baked goods -- s'mores,
moon pies, &c. -- the unwritten law is "the marshmallow goes on
the inside," the better to protect the chewing public from the
<EM>Unheimlichkeit</EM> of fingering the marshmallow hive-mind.
Sno-balls ignore this important stricture, even going so far as
to dust the things with coconut sprinkles inevitably reminiscent
of pubic hair. Heironymous Bosch would have chorfed these things
by the armload. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Orange Cupcakes</SPAN><BR>
They're orange. They don't really taste like oranges, though. They're
vaguely citric, but not something you'd want to accuse an actual orange
of contributing to. They're very orange, though, somewhere between
"Orange Crush orange" and "Sunny Delight orange." The sort of orange you
figure could substitute for road flares in a pinch. As if they were
designed to coordinate well with a home made entirely out of 
marshmallow circus peanuts. And they taste kinda that way, too. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tiger Tails</SPAN><BR>
Boy, that's an appetizing name! I can taste the fur already! And they
look for all the world like Twinkies that have been decorated by
third-graders! Thus we continue in the grand Hostess tradition of
minor revamps of classic treats, the better to stomp Little
Debbie back into the unfertile soil from which she was summoned. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Wheels</SPAN><BR>
Let me admit here that I was never really into cars as a kid. Sure,
I could recognize anything David Hasselhoff drove
as a cool car, but by and large my thought was, "I can't drive one myself,
why bother." I was, however, into superheroes, and that's where
Hot Wheels came in. Some of them, you see, had the little doors
that open. Pop both of those pups open, and you've got yourself
Supercar, the car that can fly! Of course, nowadays I get the image
of a car soaring through the air with a little digitized voice
repeating "Your door is ajar" over and over again. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Cinnamon Candy</SPAN><BR>
One of the great wailing tragedies of the candy industry is
that "red," for some twisted reason, has come to denote both 
"cherry" and "cinnamon." Which means that when you grab a
bunch of unidentified red candy, you're taking life into your own
hands. Each candy unit is like a cheap choose-your-own-adventure
paperback of taste. Will you get the pinnacle of human achievement
that is artificial cherry flavor, or will you be thrown into
the unpleasant lake of cinnamon? And wouldn't it be great
if "Candyland" featured "The Unpleasant Lake of Cinnamon"? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Sauce</SPAN><BR>
I can't get over this stuff. It makes everything taste better, and yet
it makes everything taste like hot sauce. Even better, lot of little
chi-chi hot sauce boutiques carry varieties with names like "Acid Rain 
Hot Sauce," "Scorned Woman Hot Sauce," "Jump Up and Kiss Me Hot Sauce,"
and "Jump Up and Pour Acid Down Your Throat at Breakfast, You Macho
Idiot, See if I Care Hot Sauce." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Air Balloons</SPAN><BR>
A really remarkable an efficient mode of transport, if you happen to
want to go in the direction the wind's blowing. I once witnessed
Albuquerque, New Mexico's "Hot Air Balloon Festival," an
event much beloved by people who make scenic calendars, and it gave
me one of the most profound insights of my life. As the balloons
filled and lifted delicately into the clear azure morning sky, one
after the other, until the sky was filled with their bright colors,
I thought "It looks like a photo taken right as someone
dumped out the biggest box of Trix in the universe. Huh." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Dogs</SPAN><BR>
Why is it that everyone who has created some sort of
meat substitute out of carageenan and cardboard decides to market
it in the form of hot dogs? Do vegetarians crave Ball Park Franks over 
all other forbidden foods? Is it that you can roll something
into a tube, dye it vaguely red, and call it a hot dog? Or, as I
suspect, is it so that you can give it a cute product name? 
(i.e. "Kelp-based meat substitute" becomes "Sea Dogs.") At any rate, hot
dogs come under the wide category of "food I will eat, enjoy, and
regret because it makes my mouth feel greasy for a week despite 
repeated acts of hygiene." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hot Tubs</SPAN><BR>
These are wildly overrated. I mean, okay, alone or with a close friend
whom you want to see naked, this can be nice, like a hot bath. But I'm
in California, where we jump into hot tubs in social situations where
people in more sane states would just play Pictionary. Under these
circumstances, hot tubs can be uncomfortably like public transportation,
except you're wet, naked, and you don't go anywhere. <B>C-</B></P>

By this I mean the rectangular type with nondescript chocolate "bread" on
either side. These are fun, even though the chocolate material clings to
your fingers with a ferocity rarely seen outside of the orange crap on
Chee-Tos. The major selling point is in the Neapolitan version though,
where you can learn a lot about yourself from whether you eat the
strawberry, chocolate or vanilla third first, or eat all three at once
in some misguided attempt at egalitarian chorfing. I don't know exactly

chewy, the ice cream second rate, they're often called "Drumsticks"
which isn't appetizing for a dessert no matter how you interpret it,
and half the peanuts fall off and cower in the bag, but they've got a
certain marginally symmetrical charm. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mice</SPAN><BR>
Many a cartoonist otherwise out of ideas has gotten yards of ostensible
hilarity out of sticking a slice of Swiss cheese next to a computer mouse.
Supposedly this sort of juxtaposition of linked, yet disparate elements
is the essence of humor, but it just makes me think of what it would be

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Laptop Nipples</SPAN><BR>
You know what I mean, the little blue nub on some laptops that you
poke around with a finger. I don't know what the official name is,
probably "trackpointer" or something equally lame, but the vernacular
term is immediately evocative, so let's go with it. I haven't used
these much, but I'm against them mainly on the principle that if the
same cartoonists who put cheese next to computer mice get these

This is easily the most natural form of input for people who

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Potato Bugs</SPAN><BR>
"Fouler insect never swarmed or flew, nor creepy toad was gross as
'tato bug. Remove the cursed thing before I freak." -- Wm. Shakespeare,
<CITE>Betty and Veronica</CITE>, Act 1, Scene 23. I can't even go into
how nightmarish these vile little affronts to decency and aesthetics are.
If I were having an Indiana Jones-style adventure, the Nazis would lock
me in a crypt with a herd of potato bugs. And, I might add, I'd choke
myself to death with my own whip right then and there rather than let
a single evil little one of them touch my still-living body. They're
still better than Scrappy-Doo, though. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ladybugs</SPAN><BR>
Now this is what I like in an insect. Brightly colored and small with no
stingers or noxious substance glands or pinchers or high-pitched whining
in the middle of the night or hideous claws dripping with the congealed
blood of innocents or unfortunate interest in ceramic collectibles. And
it has a nice little rhyme. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stick Insects</SPAN><BR>
I like the idea of an insect that looks like something other than
an insect. I think we should expand on the idea and encourage, through
prayer and/or genetic tampering -- the development of cigarette butt
insects, 9-volt battery insects, and ethernet card insects. Or at least
a Pixy Stick insect. As long as they're either locked in zoos and
laboratories or native to someplace I'm not going. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fleas</SPAN><BR>
Our society has an odd relationship with the concept of the flea.  We make
them into cartoon characters, subject them to scanning microscopy, and
name our rock stars after them.  They're easily our favorite bloodsucking,
plague-spreading parasite, and yet we spend massive amounts of money to
keep them the hell off our cats. There's a lesson here about the American
approach to celebrity, but I haven't had breakfast yet so I'm not going
to pursue it. <B>C-</B></P>

Sure they're swarming biting pests, but they have a neat name. It sounds

A Circle K candy aisle filled with Punkies, No-See-Ums and, say, Chiggers

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">E.T.</SPAN><BR>
Okay, more of a tourist than an invader, but it's tough
to tell the difference sometimes.
You notice there's not a lot of E.T. nostalgia out there,
compared to, say, Star Wars. I think this is because of
the hanky factor. Looking back on the first time you saw 
Star Wars, you think "Robots! Starfighters! I was on the
edge of my seat!" Looking back on E.T. you think "I
cried like a pre-schooler over the death of a walking
sausage." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Greys</SPAN><BR>
The problem with these guys is that as alien invaders go,
they seem to lack a master plan. You'd think forty years of
abductions would provide them with all the biological data they
need. My suspicion is that they're not actually softening us up for
eventual tyrannical domination as one might hope, but rather just
filling some sort of interplanetary government job in the
Bureau of Abduction and Unpleasant Probing, Sweater-Wearing Primate
Division. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Audrey II</SPAN><BR>
If flesh-eating alien invaders have traditionally suffered from
one drawback, it's that they didn't sing R&amp;B music. Thankfully,
this was remedied when they made "Little Shop of Horrors" into
a musical. Now if they just take my advice and make a movie
about a terpsichorean vampire called "Dark Lord of the Dance."
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Those Aliens From "Independence Day"</SPAN><BR>
I have to say, I'm torn on these guys. On one hand,
any species that can be taken out with one punch
by a rapper-cum-sitcom-star has some serious lack going on,
but on the other hand, I'm damn impressed with the
Dead Brent Spiner Hand Puppet Trick. I really think
they should take that one on the road. A gooey alien
with a talking Brent Spiner corpse is about the only thing
that could get me to watch "Live at the Improv." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cylons</SPAN><BR>
They eventually invaded, in the TV-movie "Galactica 1980," which
would be a great name for a roller disco. You gotta love these guys,
for various and sundry reasons. First, there's the Throbbing Robot Eye,
which set a standard for cheesy TV sci-fi effects that influenced, um,
"Knight Rider." Secondly, the head Cylon was named "Imperious Leader."
Now that's a title. Thirdly, they talk with the same 
computer-generated monotone that nearly destroyed the world in "Wargames."
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Aliens from War of the Worlds</SPAN><BR>
They came. They blew things up. They were destroyed by microbes.
More importantly, they weren't destroyed by a computer virus or
time travel. A model hostile alien force. If that isn't enough
to convince you, note that the movie was recorded in 
"Western Electric Multi-Track Magnetic Stereophonic Sound," and
the poster slogan called the film a "mighty panorama of Earth-shaking 
fury as an army from Mars invades." Any invaders that can

Good name! Much better than "Humility Bar" or "Reasonable Self-Assessment

Okay, think flat M and Ms, only without the lettering. Instead,
the yellow ones have happy faces printed on them. But only the
yellow ones. And they have this kind of fruity flavor to them.
It's very strange. Anyhow, I think devouring happy faces will be

I call this "Marshmallow Head" not because there's any evidence
that that's what it's actually called, but because of the horrid,
malformed, twitching, spandex-wearing mockery of cartooning on
the package. The half-strawberry (divided lengthwise) marshmallows
on the inside are reasonably tasty, but putting Marshmallow Head
on the outside is like putting Cerberus at the gates. He disturbs

Foreign snacks, I've discovered, tend to taste different even
when they're the close equivalent of something available opposite
People magazine at a check-out line near you. These individually-wrapped
travelers, for instance, are just fruit chews, not unlike Starburst
without the right angles. But there's something about them that's
very different, the bouquet of a subtly different blend of preservatives
or something. Maybe it's just the taste of strict rabbinical oversight. <B>C+</B></P></TD>

Hazelnut is, to my way of thinking, a vastly underused flavor. Outside

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Jabberwock</SPAN><BR>
Given that so many words in the poem are "portmanteaus," which is to say
made up of two smaller words, we can only assume that the Jabberwock was
intended to be a combination of "jock" and "abbey," in other words a sort
of athletic nun. That would explain the "claws that catch." Presumably it
also has legs that run for touchdowns and a blood-stained wimple. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Vorpal Blades</SPAN><BR>
Dungeons and Dragons had a vorpal blade available, among other ludicrous magic
items such as portable holes. A friend once pointed out that, one assumes, the
main feature distinguishing Vorpal Blades from other magic swords is that they
go "snicker-snack." Product placement aside, that's got to get annoying after
a while. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bandersnatches</SPAN><BR>
Jabberwocks and Jub-Jub birds, frankly, don't sound that tough. Bandersnatches,
however, seem pretty menacing, especially if you're a bander. And the one in the
poem is <EM>frumious</EM>, which is a combination of "furious" and "rum," meaning
an angry drunk. Let the kid from the story take on an angry, boozed-up Bandersnatch!
Then we'll see who's galumphing! <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chortling</SPAN><BR>
Carroll fans like to point out that this started out as a nonsense word, but
now it's in the dictionary, even those cheap little dictionaries you get when you
subscribe to newsmagazines. The thing of it is, though, that the meaning seems to
have changed. In <CITE>Jabberwocky</CITE>, the father of the protagonist chortles
in joy at seeing his son return. By the modern definition, that would go something like
this: "Ah, my child has returned to me after I thought he was messily killed! A-<EM>hyuk</EM>,
a-<EM>hyuk</EM>!" Doesn't quite work. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tumtum Trees</SPAN><BR>
I like the idea of Tumtum Trees. I'd like to raise Tumtum Trees, along with the world-choking
Baobabs from from <CITE>The Little Prince</CITE>. Although to be honest, I
imagine the two looking exactly the same. I'd raise them from mere Tumtum Saplings, occasionally
going for walks among them, musing uffishly under their expansive branches. And then I'd chop them down
for lumber, because who wouldn't want a genuine Tumtum dresser or nightstand? <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pocky</SPAN><BR>
These are little cookie-like sticks dipped in chocolate. Very straightforward,
and more addictive than "Ben and Jerry's Crack N' Tobacco Crunch." They
also have Melon Pocky, Coconut Pocky, Giant Pocky, some sort
of crunchy Pocky which I think has toffee or something, and 
"Pocky for Men." I'm not sure if those last ones have testosterone
in them or just look good with a suit and tie, but there's
a certain macho appeal to eating a <EM>man's</EM> chocolate-covered
cookie snack. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Everyburger</SPAN><BR>
Certainly there's no dearth of food shaped like other food in Western
culture -- I had a Jell-O salad shaped like a pig just last week --
but Everyburger deserves big handclaps for attention to detail. The
darned things look unnervingly like hamburgers. The chocolate "meat"
is precisely the correct color, and the cookie "bun" actually has
miniscule "sesame seeds." If Goldfish Crackers had that much devotion to 
verisimilitude, they'd all have little glazed eyes staring helplessly
up at you. And who wouldn't enjoy that? <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Seasoned Cuttlefish Crackers</SPAN><BR>
I don't want to ever hear you say I never ate seasoned cuttlefish
crackers for you. They're even shaped like cuttlefish, although
I must admit I haven't spent enough time around cuttlefish to
tell how precise the likeness is. If you've ever eaten shrimp chips,
they taste kind of like those. If you've never eaten shrimp chips,
you're probably not going to want to start at this late
stage of the game. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Glico Something or Other</SPAN><BR>
More candy. I picked this one up because it had both a triumphant
athlete and a wooden toy duck on the box. Unable to drum up the
faintest connection between the two, I bought it. This is a common
experience with me and Japanese candy. Anyhow, the wooden toy duck
is because the box contains a wooden toy duck, and the triumphant
athlete is because the packaging designer was insane. The box also contains weird
squishy strawberry candy, kind of like gummi candy with no will to live.
There's just no sports connection whatsoever. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Meiji, um, Things</SPAN><BR>
I don't know what these are, except that they're vaguely reminiscent of
Fun-Yuns. Judging from the packaging, I had assumed they would taste like
a happy frog, a hungry little guy with a beard, or a bowl of soup.
Upon prying open the bag, however, I was greeted with the familiar aroma
of curry and relief. These are quite tasty! They're little crunchy curry 
units! I can dig it! <B>B</B></P>

Aside from the fact that these 'bellys only add to the confusion

I have a real problem with the "crushed" part of the name. I know the

<P><B>Curly Brackets</B><BR>
These are indispensable in programming (where they usually indicate a block of looping code) and emoticons (where they usually indicate a mustache) but I'm not entirely clear on where they'd show up in normal written text.  Parenthetical statements on wedding invitations, perhaps.  Or citations of illuminated manuscripts.  <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>Tilde</B><BR>
I know what this is for, I'm just surprised that it gets its own key and the noble umlaut doesn't.  It's not even very useful for ASCII art, because font designers can't seem to agree whether it belongs at the top of the line or in the middle.  I suggest we decide that by itself it's pronounced as a nasal "gn," such as the noise made by an annoyed Curly or an aroused Squiggy.  <B>C-</B></P>

<P><B>Commercial A</B><BR>
Okay, incredibly important point here: To anyone who's spent enough time on the Internet to get cold chills when receiving mail with the subject "Very Funny! Read!", the commercial a is pronounced "at." So those clever motherfuckers among you who come up with spelling like "One-D@y Am@zing De@l S@le," are subjecting us to a mental pronunciation that comes out like "One Datee Amatzing Deattle Sattle." Stop it.  <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>Pound Sign</B><BR>
The name of this has only recently been standardized, and many still refer to it as a hash symbol, an octothorp, or a "tic-tac-toe board for little tiny miniature people." I don't mind the name, but on the other hand I've never seen it used to actually indicate pounds either in the scale sense or the quid sense.  ("My quid sense is tingling!") I like to think of it as coming from the practice of pounding the phone buttons after going through one too many labyrinthine voice mail systems, but that's probably due to my fanciful nature.  <B>B</B></P>

I have, at various points in my life, been in the position to use
both some form of DOS and some form of UNIX.  Those of you who have
no duck-strangling idea what I'm talking about, just smile and nod.
The only point here is that DOS uses backslashes a lot and UNIX uses
forward slashes a lot and the effect of using both is somewhat like having
Darth Vader for homeroom and Yoda for first period.  Many say that DOS is
the dark side, but actually UNIX is more like the dark side: It's less
likely to find the one way to destroy your incredibly powerful machine,
and more likely to make upper management choke.  <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bingo</SPAN><BR>
This has all the signs of a good kids song. It's repetitive,
simple, and it incorporates an excuse to make extra noise.
The only improvement I could come up with would be to substitute
cymbal for the handclaps. Or maybe an airhorn. "BRAAAP BRAAAP
N-G-O!" That would make for a happy class of kindergarteners. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Old McDonald</SPAN><BR>
The nice thing about this song is that invites improvisation.
What did old McDonald have on his farm? Ducks? Moose? Fusion-powered
space-warping robots? As long as you can come with a noise for it,
or in a pinch some sort of mime, then you can slip it right in there.
I personally like "On that farm he had a Nixon." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Farmer in the Dell</SPAN><BR>
Why all the songs about farmers? Are farmers that scintillating?
Actually, now that I think about it, maybe Old McDonald had a dog
named Bingo and is at this very moment in the dell. 
If we can just prove that McDonald at some
point came rolling home, and that his wife ate the eensy-weensy spider,
who them wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her, we might
be able to put together the Grand Unified Kids Song Theory. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wheels on the Bus</SPAN><BR>
As far as I'm concerned, this is just a sad attempt to bring 
Old McDonald into a non-pastoral environment, only without as

Can I be excused to go ponder the lack of a meaning in a life where
personal sorrow is as common as juice breaks? Or, as so often happens in 
a typical elementary school career, am I expected to pretend I'm happy
and clap my damn hands anyway? It's depressing. <B>D</B></P>

We're not talking 15-speed, water-bottle-and-Lycra-style bikes here. We're
talking knobby-wheel, pedal-backwards-to-stop, foam-across-the-handlebars

could customize them! You could put decals on them ("decals" are to "stickers"

That, plus the fact that it seems like an awful lot of work to get around anywhere,

Another victim of creeping coolness. Once the province of kids and kids alone, rollerskates

These are fun for about twelve seconds, until you realize that you're not going that

less of a mode of transportation and more of a high-impact hula hoop.<B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stilts</SPAN><BR>
Same deal as pogo sticks, except that stilts at least have the possibility of being
neat. Your basic circus will show you that stilts have the potential to turn

These crack me up. Everyone has one of these, at least in this

an IHOP since the term "sawbuck" was hipster slang have a waffle
iron, apparently because of some national unconscious need to have
dented pancakes on demand. Working fire extinguisher? Nope. First-aid kit?
Nope. Waffle Iron? Of <em>course</em>! What do you think we are, 
grub-munching hunter-gatherers? Plus, and this is the kicker, the damn things

<em>easy</em>, just <em>possible</em>. <B>C</B></P> 

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Food Dehydrator</SPAN><BR>
I think the infomercial apes who hawk these things would probably 
disagree that this only makes one thing. As far as they're concerned,
these pups are like a magical chef, preparing delights from tasty
chipped beef to delicious apricot chews. But from my point of view,
jerky is jerky. Thus you get beef jerky, turkey jerky, apple jerky,
plantain jerky, what have you. And you know what? There's a reason
jerky typically comes in half-ounce packets. Nobody needs extra
jerky. Remember that. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ice Cream Maker</SPAN><BR>
These actually come in several varieties, ranging
from "churn till your arm falls off" to "stick it in the freezer and go 
watch TV." These are great for teaching children about the lack of
reward for hard work. If you churn, it's not worth it. If you deposit it in
the freezer, it's not really hand-crafted. Either way it's more expensive than
the store brand and less tasty than Ben and Jerry's. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Toaster</SPAN><BR>
An elegant solution to a thorny and chronic problem. I've been kind of
low on appliances since I got an apartment of my own, and while I
haven't missed waffle one, I'm amazed at how difficult it is to get
satisfactory toast without a toaster. The oven only cooks it on one side, 
toaster ovens usually do the same and are a mess besides. So here's to
the toaster: long may it warm our hearts and our bread. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snack-Master</SPAN><BR>
I dig on these. In case you're not up on Snack-Master, it's basically
Play-Doh press meets Betty Crocker. In essence, you put a couple slices 
of bread in it, load it up with whatever you like on bread, latch that
pup closed and it heats the concoction, seals the edges, toasts a
pretty shell pattern into it, and boom -- Hot Whatever Sandwich. The
great thing about this is, it's a perfect solution to the perennial
"how do I make lunch from bread, hoi sin sauce, and cocktail onions"
conundrum. Everything tastes better with a pretty shell pattern on it.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rice Cooker</SPAN><BR>
The amazing thing about rice is that not only is it easy to screw up,
but you can screw it up in so many ways at once. I've made rice that
was simultaneously burnt, undercooked, dry, sticky, and crunchy. So
in a purely practical sense this one wins big. Even with the

not Hall of Starchy Horrors. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cherry</SPAN><BR>
Cherry, one of the many sub-species of "Red," is the very quintessence of
Kool-Aid. It has the Kool-Aid nature. Liking Kool-Aid but not liking red
Kool-Aid would be like liking the Beatles but not liking "Yesterday,"
or being into Jesus but not approving of the whole beard-and-robe thing.
It's the color of brake lights, it tastes like no fruit on this planet,
and it makes you want to hop around. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Purplesaurus Rex</SPAN><BR>
I dig on this. No big psychocultural reason, it just tasted good.
I say "tasted" because The Powers That Market sent it to flavor
Valhalla. You can actually replicate the taste by mixing Grape
with Lemonade, but it strikes me as losing the point to get into Kool-Aid
alchemy, unless of course you're mixing it with gin and/or vodka. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Great Bluedini</SPAN><BR>
A discontinued flavor, thank God. The idea here was that the
powder changed colors upon dampening. And change colors it did, from
light bluish-green to dark bluish-green. It was the most pathetic
marketing scheme since "flavor curls." It was a travesty of all things
magical. Plus it tasted like watery, sugary Odwalla Superfood. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lemonade</SPAN><BR>
Normally in double-blind tests I inevitably prefer artificial flavors
to the actual fruit upon which they're patterned, but I have to
make an exception for lemonade. Well-made lemonade is tart and 
crisp; artificial lemonade is blah and blah. I mean, I'll take
Lemonade Kool-Aid over Country Time just because of that 
commercial with the eerie old guy, but when I've got a real jones for
lemonade I hit Hot Dog on a Stick. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cola</SPAN><BR>
Only available in Mexico. No, really. I've never tried this. 
I can't imagine it would be all that tasty, but I have to admit to
a certain twisted fascination. What would it be like to drink Cola
Kool-Aid? To mix tan power into a pitcher of <EM>brown</EM> Kool-Aid,
to taste that blend of flat cola flavor and the ineffable Kool-Aid
je ne sais whatever? And consider this: Coca-Cola originally contained cocaine,
and Kool-Aid was originally named "Fruit Smack." Coincidence? I think not.
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sharkleberry Fin</SPAN><BR>
Unless my memory for soft drinks is failing me, this flavor was profoundly
wrong. This was back when Kool-Aid R&amp;D had basically given up
on trying to maintain parallels between Kool-Aid flavors and colors and 
those of actual fruit.  Sharkleberry Fin was pink. Not just pink, but 
dishwashing-liquid-pink. Pearly Pepto-Bismol pink. It looked like
Kewpie doll bile. And it tasted, well, let's just say it
was about as tasty as one could expect a "sharkleberry" to be.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fried Chicken Snack</SPAN><BR>
What a monumentally good idea! A cracker that tastes like fried chicken!
As a fan of both Kentucky "For God's Sake Don't Say Fried" Chicken and
Chicken in a Bisket, I was really looking forward to sampling these
drumstick-shaped snack units. Too bad they don't actually taste
a damn thing like chicken. The flavor is, if I had to come up with an analogy,
like two-day-old mustard-covered funnel cake. I never really acquired
a taste for two-day-old mustard-covered funnel cake. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Prawn Peanut Ball</SPAN><BR>
Um. Good heavens. The label says "peanut 36%" but all things considered
I would have voted for peanut 98%. Each crunchy seafood-legume ball is
made up of an innocent peanut encased in a vaguely sweet prawn crisp shell.
They're like Peanut M&Ms as envisioned by a crazed wizard in a tower someplace.
And if that's not enough, the package has a disturbingly vivid picture
of a whole prawn, its beady black eye glaring at you as if to say "Hey,
I'm as upset about it as you are, bub." <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pinkbell</SPAN><BR>
Apparently Disney lawyers haven't quite got their animated tentacles into
every nook and cranny of world commerce, because the pixie mascot of
Pinkbell is shall we say familiar to anyone who ever watched "The Wonderful
World of Disney." They claim to only have four ingredients, none of
which contain word fragments like "hydroxyl," so I can only congratulate
the Korean food industry on their ability to make more-or-less natural
ingredients taste like the polymer-based snacks I know and love. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tako Chips</SPAN><BR>
I appreciate the makers of Tako Chips not subjecting me to a photorealistic
rendering of an octopus on the package. Instead, we have a cap-wearing
cartoon octopus expelling the words "LIGHT & CRISPY" from what appear
to be his nasal passages. Anyhow, avoid these. I've eaten a lot of
seafood-based snacks -- too many in fact -- in the line of duty, and
these aren't bad until you actually swallow them. Then the aftertaste
assaults your senses like the gustatory equivalent of the dream sequence
in <CITE>Rosemary's Baby.</CITE> <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Roasted Rice Candy</SPAN><BR>
I have a love-hate-love-dislike-hate-appreciate-like-love-hate relationship
with these candies. They taste like roasted rice, all righty. And yes, that's
revolting. But once you get past the revoltingness, they're actually pretty
good. My brain is going "These taste hideous, and I'm going to
have a craving for them again in a few days." Weird. Eerie. 
Wait, no, just weird. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wrinkled Strawberry Tubes</SPAN><BR>
I opened these up and said to myself "Hey! Pink Chee-tos!" And
indeed, they look just like strawberry Chee-tos. Also, they taste
like strawberry Chee-tos, in the sense of having sort of a cheesy
flavor to them, in spite of their not containing any actual cheese.
Most of you have probably gotten through life without ever having
considered that light pink Chee-tos would look a lot like fat maggots.
But not any more. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hydra</SPAN><BR>
Kudos (Greek!) to Hercules for thinking outside the ampitheatre on
this one by cauterizing the neck wounds of this serpentish creature,
thus keeping two heads from growing where before there had been only the one,
but it seems to me there was another way out. If he had just kept chopping,
eventually the creature would have had a hundred thousand heads, making
it look something like venomous reptilian broccoli. Then it would have
tipped over and been no threat to anyone. People could come up and
laugh at it, it would have been a great tourist attraction.  <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Stymphalian Birds</SPAN><BR>
This labor doesn't get much press, because driving away a huge flock
of birds lacks a certain legendary quality. One is put in the mind of
toddlers merrily wading through pigeons. Not only that, but the turning
point in this labor involves magical castanets. Hercules plays the magical
castanets, the birds start to fly in terror, Hercules shoots them down.
Pretty lame. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Apples of the Hesperides</SPAN><BR>
The good bit in this one is not the Apples themselves, but
Hercules' little foray into vaudeville. For reasons not entirely clear,
Hercules asked Atlas, of holding-up-the-world fame, to go fetch the Apples
while he, Hercules, handled the world-supporting duties for a while.
Upon returning, Atlas quite sensibly decided he didn't want his old job
back after all. So Herc pretends to be fine with this, and asks Atlas
to hold up the world for just a sec while he goes to get some 
fluffy pillows. Atlas obliges and Herc grabs the Apples and splits.
Wah-wah-waaaaaaah! <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Nemean Lion</SPAN><BR>
Now this is a great labor. The deal with the lion is that its hide
couldn't be pierced by spears or arrows, which were only two real choices
of armament at that point in history. So Hercules strolls in and chokes
the beast to death with his <EM>bare hands</EM>! Then he <EM>skins it</EM>!
Then he wears the skin as a nifty little <EM>cloak-and-hat number</EM>!
Then he does the <EM>happy lion mambo</EM>! That last one is pure
supposition, but it's what I would have done. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mares of Diomedes</SPAN><BR>
This isn't that interesting of a Labor, but the monsters in question are
interesting. They're man-eating mares. You have to respect man-eating
horses, because they really have to work at it. Your man-eating tigers
and pumas are set up with the slashing teeth and the knife-like claws
and so forth, which are to man-eating as a Cuisinart is to 
coleslaw. Man-eating mares, on the other hand, have to pummel their
prey to death with hooves, then chew on the flesh with that thoughtful
grinding motion horses have, both of which are much less efficient. I
admire their dedication to the craft of man-eating. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Cerynitian Hind</SPAN><BR>
The Task: Catch a deer. The Challenge: The deer belongs to the goddess
Diana. The Solution: Just wound that mother and hope Diana doesn't get
too pissed. Personally, I think it would have been more entertaining if
Hercules had come up with a sitcom-ish scheme involving cross-dressing
and getting stuck in a meat locker, possibly with a cameo by Brooke Shields.
But I think this was before the invention of Brooke Shields. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Augean Stables</SPAN><BR>
I was really hoping to pick up some cleaning tips from this one. Sure,
my own messes tend to involve Lego instruction books and empty two-liter
bottles of store-brand soda rather than horse offal, but one can dream.
As it turns out, Herc's solution -- divert a river through the offending
area -- is of no practical use. Once again I find I have nothing to
learn from the super-strong. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Erymanthean Boar</SPAN><BR>
Hercules' task is -- big surprise -- to capture a ferocious animal. This
episode has a subplot involving wine and centaurs, but that basically goes
nowhere and at the end we're again left with a defeated lower vertebrate
and a smug demigod. Hey, maybe Jesus and Hercules could trade jobs for
a day!  Hercules could feed a multitude and Jesus could assault a vicious
pig and everyone would be enriched by the experience. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Cretan Bull</SPAN><BR>
This, culture fans, is the same bull that fathered the Minotaur by a
process as disturbing as it is anotomically unlikely. This is a bull
that was offered up from the sea by Poseidon when Poseidon was apparently in
a weird mood. In short, this is a bull with history, which is good
because Hercules pretty much just wrestled it to the ground so there's
not much to say about that. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Belt of Hippolyte</SPAN><BR>
This must have been a nice change of pace from playing the ancient Greek
version of the Crocodile Hunter. ("Just LOOK at this goiant boah! He's
BAYOOTIFOHL!") He gets to go for a nice sail, meet a cool woman and
take her clothing. And it all goes so well, up until the mass slaughter.
At first Hippolyte is cool with the plan, but then the goddess Hera incites
the Amazons to attack and Herc's Greek buddies sound the alarm and the
blood and spear-throwing and death and it's all very depressing.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Cattle of Geryon</SPAN><BR>
To get the cattle in question, Herc had to fight Geryon, a guy with
three heads and Orthus, his dog with two heads. What is it with
Greek mythology and heads? I can just see little Greek kids yawning
when they hear about a demigod facing a monster with only the one head.
Admittedly, the Greek approach would make the "Charlie's Angels"
movie more interesting, but there's such a thing as restraint. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cerberus</SPAN><BR>
Now this is more like it. Sure it's another animal, but at least it
lives in the Underworld. The Greek Underworld kicks ass. It's like "Six
Flags Over Psychotic Depression," and Cerberus is the Ultra Twister.
Far from the simple three-headed puppydog he's usually depicted as,
Cerberus was also equipped with a back full of snakes and a venemous tail.
Thanks to the impenetrable lion skin and the power of foreshadowing,
though, Herc got through this one just fine. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Detergent Vending Machines</SPAN><BR>
In these days of buttons and beeps it's refreshing to
find one of the old soap box vending machines that
works via levers and gravity. I can imagine early Hittite vending
machines built on the same principles, forty slaves employed to shift the
lever to "Biz," and another forty to pull the knob. Many would
be crushed by the huge cardboard box that came crashing down,
but their sacrifice to their despotic god-ruler would not
be forgotten, and in the next life they would be elevated to
the status of "New Improved Slave with April-Fresh Garments." <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fabric Softener</SPAN><BR>
Call me calloused, but I've never suffered from hard clothes.
As long as the mustard stains come out, I'm not usually concerned
about such niceties as making sure that my towels are soft enough to
adequately cushion the impact of falling teddy bears. Speaking of
which, tell me the Snuggle bear isn't eerie. It encapsulates everything
that's wrong with puppetry today. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Dryer Lint</SPAN><BR>
You know, if someone volunteered to be the George Washington Carver
of dryer lint, I bet we could find enough ecologically sound uses
for the stuff to make hemp look like Styrofoam hamburger boxes by comparison.
Lint will save the planet! I fully expect next year's globally-conscious
hipsters to be sporting their 100% organic lint jackets and baseball
caps. 
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Carts</SPAN><BR>
Is there such thing as a laundry cart in good condition, or
do they come straight out the factory with a bent hanger bar and a stuck wheel?
These were a lot more fun when I was a kid and my brother and I would play
Laundry Cart Drag Racing, switching off between being
the pilot/helpless-victim-of-dryer-collisions and the cart-pusher/Mom-lookout. 
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Posters</SPAN><BR>
There's this one series of laundromat posters that look like they were 
created circa 1963 by the same creative minds that brought you
get well cards about nurse bosoms. The most memorable of these has
a freaky-looking cartoon mortician saying "Don't Dye Here." Pretty weird,
but considering that most laundromat hours I've logged to date have 
been spent fighting off choking boredom, a little visual diversion
is welcome, no matter how unsettling. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bulletin Boards</SPAN><BR>
I don't know who decided that laundromats are the social and economic centers
of the modern world, but at least these provide a bit of entertainment.
I mean, if you've seen one Strat for sale you've seen them all, and if
I wanted my house cleaned, my back massaged, or my income invested
in multi-level marketing schemes, I probably wouldn't go to the bulletin
boards at the 'mat, but it's always interesting to see what
kind of requirements people have for roommates, ("Must not eat meat,
worship graven images, laugh at Yo-Yo Ma's name.") and what local
cultural activities are coming up ("Master of the Latvian Armpit Banjo!").

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sundials</SPAN><BR>
In spite of the fact that ancient Romans probably 
would have swapped any number of valuable art relics 
for  a single Sailor Moon digital watch, people still 
love to put sundials on their lawns and in their 
gardens. This reverence for the obsolete is oddly 
selective -- nobody seems to want to bring back 
smallpox for that retro forties effect, but clocks made 
out of concrete are big business. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flamingos</SPAN><BR>
The disturbing thing is not that they're plastic. The 
disturbing thing is not that they're pink. The 
disturbing thing is that they only have one leg. 
People across the Midwest are decorating their lawns 
with deformed mutant bottom feeding birds. What 
pleasure they extract from peering out at their twisted 
mockeries of avian life I can't fathom. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Windmill Flowers</SPAN><BR>
This is what I love about middle American home 
decor: they just can't leave well enough alone. It's not 
too tough to grow some nice flowers, but no matter 
what you plant--peonies to orchids--they won't spin in 
merry circles when the wind blows. But plastic, as 
usual, comes to the rescue. Stick some windmill 
flowers in the soil and they'll spin to beat the band, 
assuming your band needs beating. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Topiary</SPAN><BR>
A charming decoration combining the soothing urban-
pastoral effect of hedges with the disturbing eerieness 
of mounted deer heads. There's nothing that says "I 
have a giant scrubby rabbit on my lawn" like a giant 
scrubby rabbit on your lawn. My thought is that the 
ultimate sporting spectacle would be if we could 
somehow get a topiary rabbit and an ice sculpture 
swan to battle to the death. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gnomes</SPAN><BR>
Hey, who doesn't want short people in funny hats on 
their lawn? Heck, that's the only reason people throw 
kids' birthday parties. And you don't even have to buy 
lawn gnomes high-powered water rifles, although the 
idea is not without its appeal. Where flamingos are 
merely tacky, lawn gnomes are actively weird. <B>A-</B></P>

<P>In a little over two years, there's going to be a presidential election,
and we'll be forced to trot out the obligatory spoof campaign
("Sj&ouml;berg/Neilsen 2000: They're Not 35, But We Won't Tell If You Don't").
So we figured we'd better start ramping up our platform now if
we don't want to be steamrollered by the powerful 
"Scary/Baby 2000" campaign engine. ("They're Not 
Americans, But We Won't Tell If You Don't")</P>

<P>So here's our first proposal, which will be upgraded to "demand"
if the polls warrant. We want warning labels on our laws. Congress
churns out gobs of laws every year, only a handful of which end up
actually being something we have to pay attention to. In the interest
of freeing up time to play America's National Sport, Foosball (That's
our other proposal), we want congress to add a simple rating to
every law they pass to let us know if we actually have to pay attention.

The archest of arch-nemeses, so diabolical that he can make even Superman
have to sit down and try to figure things out every once in a while. A
man this twisted must have a truly dark and smoldering motive, such as
oh say baldness. That's right, the Superfriends-era Lex got his start on the
Road to Doom because Superman accidentally made all his hair fall out
when he was a kid. This lead L.L. to invent giant robots and all sorts
of beam-based weaponry but not, for some inexplicable reason, Rogaine.
Twenty minutes working on his actual problem instead of yet another
half-assed kryptonite delivery system could have saved a
lot of tsuris. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sinestro</SPAN><BR>
Sinestro was, in essence, Green Lantern with magenta skin and a huge
forehead. I've often figured that my own arch-enemy is probably just
me with magenta skin and a huge forehead and he's probably off having
a beer and watching The Powerpuff Girls because that's what I like to
do no matter what size my forehead is. But this isn't <EM>about</EM>
me. Sinestro had a <EM>yellow</EM> power ring, which I always assumed
had a weakness to green because that would make sense. But apparently
that's not true, and once again my hope for a rational universe is dashed
on the rocks of crappy cel animation. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gorilla Grodd</SPAN><BR>
He's an evil Gorilla, but someone named Gorilla Grodd who's a member
of the Legion of Doom has no business being anything else. He's the
arch-enemy of The Flash. The nemesis of the fastest man on earth
is a talking gorilla. That's really random. He's not a particularly
fast gorilla or a gorilla with power over the flow of time, he's
just a really strong talking gorilla with a bug up his ass. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bizarro</SPAN><BR>
How can you not like Bizarro? Him do the opposite of normal people!
Him only able to order Egg McMuffin <EM>after</EM> 10:30 AM! Him criticize

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cheetah</SPAN><BR>
What do you do when you have a scantily-clad Amazon with high-heel
boots and a "magic rope" in your television show? Why, make her
fight a woman in a skin-tight kitty outfit, of course! It's a show

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flashlights</SPAN><BR>
Sweet mother of Britney, where would we be without flashlights? I
weep to consider! Think of all the slumber party ghost stories
left unaccented by high-contrast spooky faces! Think of all the
episodes of "The X-Files" having to take place in well-lit libraries
and shopping malls! And in our sad secular age, so lacking in rituals,
how many of us knew that we had reached adulthood the day we figured out
that we can't make our own working Bat-Signal? A world without flashlights
would be tragically lacking in intrigue and uses for D-cells. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Nightlights</SPAN><BR>
As comforting as a glowing Scooby-Doo can be -- and that's mightily
comforting -- it doesn't do shit for earthquakes, which was my big
night terror growing up, and by "growing up" I mean "until I was in
college." It's a side-effect of living in California. Anyhow, in
'89 I was in a big massive headline-grabbing quake, and I survived
so I'm much better about it all. Plus I'm moving to North Carolina,
where earthquakes aren't a problem but nightlights only serve to
attract fearsome night-flying insects the size of Happy Meal toys. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Sun</SPAN><BR>
Personally, I'm against it. It's hot, I don't know if you've noticed
that, and if you get too much of it, it makes your nose fall off. Also,
it makes life on earth possible, which means that it's ultimately
responsible for those "Stacker2.com" commercials. Finally, did you know
that the sun contains 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system? Fuck that
noise! <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Headlights</SPAN><BR>
"Sure," many people say. "Headlights give us a place to put the eyes on
our cartoon automobiles, but what else are they good for?" Let me tell
you, person. Headlights make it possible to drive at night and not kill
people, so let's have no more of your scoffing. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Candles</SPAN><BR>
Nothing's quite so romantic as the ever-present possibility of dying in
a flesh-charring conflagration. When it's dark, and you're alone with
the one you love, bodies bathed in the warm glow of dozens of flickering
candles, you think about how important it is to find true love before
the house burns down. You also think of that one music video. The one
with all the candles. <B>B</B></P>

It's nice of Fisher-Price to include a dissident among all the smiling
Little Constantly Happy People. A dissident with his hat on sideways,
so you <EM>know</EM> he's trouble. He's unquestionably the sort of
hard-hearted delinquent who steals apples from Old Man Croody's yard

Mom's freaky. Her eyes are always closed, and her mouth is always open,
like some sort of deformed baby bird. Maybe the open mouth is supposed to
be a smile, but in that case she has pink teeth, which is its own set
of problems. Combine that with a stern German headmistress hairdo, and
you've got one unnerving hausfrau. Also she has no nose. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

off and her eyes will glue shut and she'll end up just like dear old mom.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sawing a Lady in Half</SPAN><BR>
Actually, contemporary versions of this trick generally use big square
steel sheets to sever the torso of the lady in question.  I don't
know why they use these; it just removes any pretense that the box
isn't tricked. "Notice I am using a perfectly ordinary wooden box that
just happens to have big slots in it for rectangular cleavers!" Plus the
steel sheets block the inside ends of the divided box. Maybe you're
supposed to think this is to shield the demure assistant's private
intestines from onlookers, but more obviously it's to keep you from seeing
whatever ungainly contortion is necessary to perform this rather mundane
trick. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Guessing a Card</SPAN><BR>
Most of us have had our card guessed by some grade-schooler who got "101
Reasonably Interesting Card Tricks Untalented Youngsters Can
Perform" as a birthday present, so when a professional does the same thing
it's about as impressive as someone getting on a swing and saying "look how high
I can go!" Many stage magicians add lots of bells and whistles involving
having the missing card appear inside the mouth of a newborn panda or
something, but it's still nothing that can't be easily accomplished with
a convincing shill and a cooperative zookeeper. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Escaping From a Straitjacket</SPAN><BR>
Actually, this isn't usually a magic trick, which is why I like it.
Some asshole pouring milk from a newspaper is just sleight-of-dairy,
but removing yourself from a reasonably tight straitjacket while
hanging from a chain or submerged in a tank of pear cider takes practice,
limberness, and most importantly actual effort. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Conjuring Some Sort of Animal</SPAN><BR>
I find magic acts most interesting when I assume that all tricks involve
the magician's pants in some way or another. If he's pulling coins from
the air, he obviously has pants full of coins. If he's levitating, he's
clearly wearing anti-gravity pants, and so on. Hey, it helps pass the
time. Anyhow, this is especially fun when the show involves conjured animals,
because you can lean over to your friends and say "He's got a dove in
his pants. Maybe three." It's less convincing when the magician is
conjuring Bengal tigers, but more fun to think about. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Linking Rings</SPAN><BR>
Nobody cares about the rings! At least with other tricks, you have the
chance of death, dismemberment, or a rabbit crawling out of someone's
pants. Hell, even with the card tricks you can always hope that the
magician guesses wrong and suffers a deep, soul-searing humiliation.
But if this trick is screwed up all you get are temporarily unlinked
rings, which in the end are about as interesting as linked rings, which
is to say only slightly more interesting than an empty stage. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Opossums</SPAN><BR>
North America gets one lousy marsupial, and let's just say it's not going
to win any beauty contests. Or even not-ugly contests.  And it wouldn't
even get past the quals in the Mammal Intelligence Open.
I used to be much more impressed with possums before one of those
scientific myth-debunking books explained that they don't so much play
dead as fall into startled comas. Another pleasant childhood metaphor
thrown under the fridge of science to rot. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wombats</SPAN><BR>
In "researching" this Rating, I discovered that Yahoo has category
called "Individual Wombats." I just think that's something people should
know. Anyhow, I'm inclined to like wombat because "wombat" is a great
name. It's got a "wom," and a "bat," and an "omba." They're kind of
nondescript animals, cute in a generic pudgy mammal way, but their name
spelled backwards is "tabmow," and that makes all the difference. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Kangaroos</SPAN><BR>
My Austrialian friends have assured me that kangaroos are actually
something of an annoying, car-bumping form of huge vermin. I don't
care, they go boing. It is the only living mammal that, when jumping,
actually makes a "boing boing boing" sound. You can hear it from
almost a mile away. "Kangaroo," in fact, is aboriginal Australian
for "boing." Okay, those are all lies but I hear it very clearly in my 
head. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tasmanian Devils</SPAN><BR>
Warner Brothers has this so tied up I'm surprised they're not suing
order Dasyuromorphia for trademark infringement. So now a whole 
generation thinks of Tasmanian Devils as living buzzsaws that strike
fear into all other species and like to pose for T-shirts, when actually
they're squat carrion-eaters who that got run out of Australia by dingos.
Dingos! <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Koalas</SPAN><BR>
Koala bears only eat one thing, day in and day out. I had the same
experience with instant ramen in college, so I can really identify with
these prototypical tree-huggers. Koalas look cuddly, but I am lead to
understand that they're actually irritable, solitary beasts who do not
want belly rubs. What kind of mocking God created creatures with poofy
ears and big black noses that don't want belly rubs? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Captain America</SPAN><BR>
Captain America is cool. And do you know why Captain America is
cool? <EM>Garbage can lids</EM>! The little wings
and the sticky-out ears I can take or leave, but as a child I
discovered that, in a world where web-shooters and batarangs
are tragically difficult to come by, you can fashion a workable
Captain America shield out of a standard round trashcan lid.
And it bruises, too! <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Incredible Hulk</SPAN><BR>
The Hulk has gone through many permutations over the
years -- smart Hulk, nice Hulk, Hulk Hogan -- but the
real appeal lies with big dumb angry Hulk. With intelligence
he's just a less-fiber-conscious Jolly Green Giant, but
the old-style "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry" Hulk says
something about the primal animal within us, about the
transience of rage, and about Bill Bixby's ability to 
look dejected. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Spider-Man</SPAN><BR>
Spider-Man's real power is his ability to attract
great theme songs. From "Slings his web, any size" to "Nobody
knows who you aaaaare!" Spidey has the best tunage this side of
Adam West's minimalist Batman 
ditty. I actually haven't caught the most recent Spider-Man cartoon,
which I assume has one of those drawn-out instrumentals so popular
with the "Animated Adventures" set these days, but even if it
sucks, it can't take away from the glory of such lines as
"Is he strong? Listen, bud/He's got radioactive blood." 
Spider-sense is really cool, too. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thor</SPAN><BR>
As much as I love to endorse the Nordic ("Endorse the Nordic" being
my favorite Dead Can Dance album), and as much as the hammer makes
a nice heroic accessory, there are a few things about The Chippendale
Dancer of Thunder that are less than thrilling. First off, why
was a Norse god talking like the King James Bible? Secondly,
why was it that every third episode someone other than Thor manages to
pick up his hammer, in spite of the mystical security measures,
and Thor reacts like this has never happened to him before in his entire
immortal existence?  And finally, why did he have big blue circles on 
his chest? His torso looked like "Twister for Beginners." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">She-Hulk</SPAN><BR>
In the halcyon days of Marvel, which is to say any period where
they published no more than one title beginning with "X-," they
often had trouble coming up with decent female heroes. The ones
that they did have usually just served as portable hostages and
had dialogue that made June Cleaver look like Exene Cervenka.
She-Hulk is a welcome exception to this rule, in spite of
having a name that makes "Ant-Man" look pretty good by comparison.
She kicks four-color butt. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Iron Man</SPAN><BR>
Not bad, not bad. A bit impersonal; even as a kid it's hard to
identify with someone with their head in a bucket, but hey, he's
got repulsor rays. Rays are good things to have. The thing of it,
and you're probably way ahead of me on this one, is that every time
I hear the phrase "Iron Man Triathlon," I get the image of some guy in 
red and gold armor pedaling a bike. Don't even get me started 
on "Iron Maiden." <B>B-</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Dr. Doom</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest evil overlord of all comicdom. First off, he has a mask, armor, and a cape, and he had it before Vader made it de rigeur. Secondly, he has his own country--Latveria--that seems to be eternally stuck in the late middle ages thanks to Doom's evil, oppressive, and largely unspecified fiscal  policies. Thirdly, he refers to himself as "Doom." Most people can't get away with referring to themselves in the third person, but most people aren't named "Doom." Finally, he has an actual doctorate. That shows he's well-rounded. <span class="ratinggrade">A+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Galactus</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Stan Lee thinks big. He came up with Galactus, a massive purple guy who eats entire planets. That's menacing! To get any more epic in scope, you'd have to have Andromedax, The Galaxy Who Shoots Other Galaxies With A Big, Galaxy-Sized Bazooka. Even better, Galactus isn't some sort of hand-chafing nefarious schemer. He's just very large, very hungry, and loves the great taste of ecospheres. <span class="ratinggrade">A+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Green Goblin</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The thing about Spider-Man is that his enemies can't just be sociopaths who like pretty things. Some are, sure, but an astonishing number of them are his best friend from high school, or his girlfriend's father, or the cat he raised from a kitten. Something angsty. So there's the Green Goblin, who's not really that inspiring as a villain. I mean, pumpkin bombs? But in his various incarnations the Green Goblin has been practically everyone on Peter Parker's speed dial. That's a little more interesting. I guess. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Red Skull</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The Red Skull is a deformed Nazi. Gosh, the Nazis made good villains. They're just nasty unpleasant people with guns, and there's no uncomfortable racist overtones to hating them. Nobody seriously talks about wiping all aryans from the planet. Who would do all the parasailing? However, the Nazis don't really have much influence these days outside of inspiring panicky newspaper articles about how some fifteen-year-old prick in Nebraska has a "Whites R Grate!" Web page, so the Red Skull doesn't get as much play as he used to. Maybe he could take up telemarketing. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Leader</p>
<p class="ratingbody">He's a green guy with a big brain. He's the Hulk's arch-enemy. Kind of obvious, really. Hero: Big green dumb strong guy. Villain: Small green smart weak guy. It's not really dripping with creativity, and the moral ends up being "clever planning and logic can never win against the sheer physical brutality of a guy who barely even knows where he is." This is not a moral that your average comic book reader wants to hear. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Magneto</p>
<p class="ratingbody">He's a supervillain AND an allegory! I've never really understood the whole anti-mutant sentiment in the Marvel Universe. People are cool with people shooting power blasts as long as it came from a radiation accident or a vitamin supplement, but not if it's genetic? I guess that's the moral point: prejudice knows no logic, but it's really handy for moving plot lines along. Anyhow, Magneto always struck me as uncomfortably Doomlike, with his helmet and plans for world conquest. He may even have his own country now. I'm not sure, I stopped reading X-Men about the same time they started putting Wolverine on the cover of comics in which he didn't actually, technically, appear. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Enchantress</p>
<p class="ratingbody">First, off, I'm annoyed that Marvel had to invent a Norse goddess to be an
adversary to Thor. It's not like the Norse pantheon didn't have goddesses
of its own. How about Lofn? She'd rock! Anyhow, the Enchantress is one
of the genre of supervillainess that keeps threatening to get the heroes
laid. The fact that this tends to be a sign of evil rather than good
says something about the perpetually intra-pubsecent mindset of most
superhero comics, but nothing that hasn't been said before. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Doctor Octopus</p>
<p class="ratingbody">There need to be more titles for supervillains. There are a bunch of doctors,
a few professors, some lords, and your assorted military ranks. How
about Chairman Pain? Or Senator Death? Or perhaps Right Honourable
Chief Justice Torment-Hassle? At any rate. By all rights,
Doctor Octopus should be much dorkier than he is. To begin with,
you're not that scary if the Japanese eat you raw. Also, he has
a haircut that's more stupid than roughly 80% of the Little Rascals.
Also, his power is "more arms." Sure, they're metal pinchy arms, but
when you get down to it, three regular guys have as many arms as he does.
Still, somehow Otto manages to pull it off. More or less. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Kraven</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The origin of Kraven, one of Spider-Man's baddies, is that Stan Lee
must have read "The Most Dangerous Game" and decided to <strike>rip it
off</strike> adapt it for the comics medium. So Kraven, too, is a hunter
who has decided to hunt the most deadly game of all: irradiated teenager!
I don't know where he got the idea that Spidey is the apex of life-forms.
I mean, Thor's running around, isn't he? Wouldn't the gods themselves
be an eensy bit more of a challenge than some kid who sticks to things?
But you know what's great about Kraven? That lion vest thing of his.
His vest looks like a lion's face. I love that. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Absorbing Man</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This guy could have been much better. I love the idea of a villain
who's really, really absorbing. The Avengers stop him in the middle
of a bank robbery or something, and he starts telling them about
the band he's going to start, or something that happened over spring
break, and the heroes just get really caught up in what he's saying.
And before they know it, a couple hours have gone by! And they're late
for something! But no, he just has the power to turn into whatever
substance he touches. Feh. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Blob</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Some superfolk have powers that can be summed up in a single word.
Fire. Ice. Light. Breasts. With The Blob, that word is "fat." The
Blob is the possessor of several hundred pounds of extra-durable
mutant power fat. The sort of fat that can deflect bullets, ensnare
fists, and do other things that no other fat can do. Except Olestra.
He also has the related yet oddly orthogonal power to increase
his own gravity. In our world these are merely things to do at
parties and ways to make friends with Jim Rose, but in the Marvel
Universe they add up to a long and lucrative career in the crime
sector. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Big Mac</SPAN><BR>
As part of an ongoing effort to become the world's first
McDonald's-compatible restaurant, Burger King recently
introduced a hamburger called the Big King. A valiant try,
but the gooey meaty mass fails to replicate the most important
aspect of a Big Mac; its ineffable Mcness. I have a theory that
all McDonald's food is actually made out of the same material --
McSubstance -- which is whipped, grilled, or frozen, and shaped into 
the various McDonald's foods and possibly Happy Meal toys. At
any rate, without this McSubstance, no restaurant can hope to
replicate Mcness to any appreciable degree. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">McD.L.T.</SPAN><BR>
Remember this? The hot side stays hot, and the cool side stays cool?
<EM>Lies!</EM> The hot side stays hot through the same cutting-edge heat lamp 
technology they use on everything, and the cool side stays, at best,
room temperature, thanks to a thin layer of seagull-choking Styrofoam.
The only real selling point for me was the tomato, which is a bit hard
to come by at McDonald's, outside of the ketchup format. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">McNuggets</SPAN><BR>
My God, these are eerie. Look at them. Go, order some, and <EM>look

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Double Quarter Pounder</SPAN><BR>
This isn't a regular menu item. They trot it out once in a while, like the
McRib sandwich, to try and inject some novelty into the McDonald's 
experience. I wonder why someone who desires novelty
would go to a McDonald's, but hey, I'm no Mayor McCheese. Anyhow, the
problem with this burger is that it's hard to imagine someone looking
at a Quarter Pounder and deciding that what it needs is more
beef. I can think of a lot of things that would improve a Quarter
Pounder, but an extra patty of meat that's taken a long drive in
frozen form isn't one of them. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Filet O'Fish</SPAN><BR>
This demonstrates one of the secrets behind the success of McDonald's:
the food names. "Filet O'Fish" captures a sense of whimsy and adventure
that you don't get with "Fried Cod Sandwich." Deep-fry a breaded fish patty
and slap it on a white bun with tartar sauce and a half-slice of
processed cheese at home, and you have a crappy old fish sandwich.
Order the same at McDonald's and you have the venerable Filet O'Fish,
part of our nation's gustatory and religious history. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Money in a Fish</SPAN><BR>
Needless to say, the ability to find money in fish is not one of Christ's
more well-advertised miracles. To begin with, coming up with cash money
sounds insufficiently Christlike. "Arise, my child, for you are healed"
sounds like something Jesus would say. "Hey look, a quarter!" does not.
Secondly, the whole thing is just a little too "News of the Weird." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Driving Out Demons</SPAN><BR>
This is a good one. Jesus comes across a guy possessed by not one,
but bunches of demons, which I imagine feels something like scabies only
with the smell of brimstone and a much deeper voice to go along with
it. For some reason the demons, realizing their infernal number is up,
beg to be sent into a nearby herd of pigs. So Christ complies and the
pigs -- all two thousand of them -- charge down and drown themselves in
a lake. I'm sure it's all very symbolic. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Water Into Wine</SPAN><BR>
According to John, this is the first miracle the Son of God performed,
and I have to say it's a good one to start the show with. It's impressive,
it's elegant, and it carries more obvious benefit than, say, changing 
a beet into a rutabaga. And He performed it for the benefit of guests
at a wedding, which shows that God loves even those too lame-brained 
to call a caterer. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Healing En Masse</SPAN><BR>
"[T]he multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to
be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see. [Matthew 15:31]" This
is an important miracle because it shows that Christ has organizational
skills. A lesser messiah might have gotten all confused in the turmoil
and then the multitude would have witnessed the crippled seeing, the
blind walking, the dumb made whole and the maimed speaking, and then
the wondering would have been more along the lines of "What the hey?" <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Walking on Water</SPAN><BR>
It's interesting to me that so many of Christ's non-healing-oriented
miracles involved water, fish, or both. Water into wine, fishes and
loaves, walking on water, the aforementioned money in a fish, and so
forth. But it's probably just as well that all this miracle-working took
place by the shore in the middle east, because not only is the ability
to walk on tundra much less impressive, but it would look pretty silly
to have the faithful attaching little outlines of caribou to their cars. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Withering a Fig Tree</SPAN><BR>
You might want to look this one up, because if you haven't read it you're
not going to believe me. It's in Matthew 21:18-22. Christ is hungry, he
sees a fig tree, but there are no figs, so in a scene reminiscent of
"The Fox and the Grapes II: The Revenge" he curses the tree so that it
will never grow fruit again. Weird. Eerie. Disturbing. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Doggie</SPAN><BR>
Ah, yes. The Gleaming Terrier of Finance. As a kid, the selling point of
the dog was that you could tilt him and pretend to make him piddle on your
opponents' hotels. Not exactly evolved comedy, but once you've chuckled
over the "Beauty Contest" card you have to take your laughs where you can
get them in Monopoly. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Shoe</SPAN><BR>
Okay, fine, shoe equals walk equals travel around the board. But what I 
want to know is, what the hell is that on the <em>back</em> of the shoe?
I mean, in practical terms it's a handle, but the car doesn't have a
random protrusion coming out of the back, why does the shoe? Is it a
shoehorn? Was there a penchant for wearing strap-enhanced footwear during
the Great Depression? Weird. Eerie. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Car</SPAN><BR>
Now <em>this</em> is the piece to have. The movement metaphor is there, as is 
the reference to riches. The sound effects were de rigeur, of course, with
the car screeching through the visiting area of the jail like a
Duke boy. Nice set of wheels, too. I wonder if there's
someplace you can buy a replica Monopoly car. <em>That'd</em> turn heads 
at the classic auto show. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Hat</SPAN><BR>
Yawn. "Hey, I'm a hat. Here I am. A hat. Felt, you know. Bask in my 
haberdashery." I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't paying attention in 
freshman drama class, but I just can't get into the the role of a
hat that invests in real estate. It sounds like a bad remake of an
old live-action Disney movie. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Guy on a Horse</SPAN><BR>
What game is this token <EM>really</EM> from? What is it doing in 
Monopoly? It's fun and all, if a tad unstable and prone to getting
stepped on and bent, but how does "ride 'em cowboy" fit in with
"fork over the rent, you peon"? Maybe it's a reference to polo or something,
but it sure looks like the Hopalong Cassidy school of equestrianism to
me. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Everyone Forgets</SPAN><BR>
What was it? I keep thinking "candlestick," but that's Clue. Martini glass?
Wad of bills? Bishop? I'm pretty sure I've seen a silver battleship, but
either that's just that expanded edition they were hawking a while ago,
or I'm getting mental boardgame cross-pollination again. Well, it can't
have been all that great, so I'll give it the generic stamp of 
mild disapproval. <B>C-</B></P>

Isn't this a bit out of character for Star Trek, particularly
Star Trek: The Next Generation? If Picard was set loose on
a Monopoly board, he'd try and establish peaceable diplomatic
relations with Marvin Gardens and give St. James Place wide berth
so that its culture could develop without interference. Hardly
the setting for a cut-throat game of property acquisition, gold-pressed
latinum or no. (Side note: the phrase "gold-pressed latinum" always
makes me think of "chicken-fried steak" for some reason. Someday
we will possess the technology to electronically change all occurrences
of the phrase "gold-pressed latinum" in the various series into
"chicken-fried steak," and that will be good.) <B>C</B></P></TD>

One of the goals of this game is to "run dealerships." This, I think,
underscores the problem with the Harley-Davidson marketing machine as of
late. The archetypical sweat-soaked, helmet-eschewing, leather-swaddled
Harley-riding badass is not someone you'd expect to aspire to run a
dealership, or for that matter do anything else associated with Monopoly
except perhaps go to jail. And even then not without a tussle. And yet
Harley is backing this board game, and various stuffed animals, and a <A

The weeping and wailing can cease, because you can now
play Monopoly in senses-shattering 3-D. It's really dumb. Monopoly
tokens and houses are already "in 3-D," so all that's left is to 
give the board a lame raised center (making it harder to roll the dice)
and scatter a couple chests around. Plus it's a puzzle, which means you
have to work to assemble it, and it doesn't fold up. It would be harder
to come up with a dumber idea for a Monopoly game without adding a

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Here Comes Santa Claus</SPAN><BR>
This is a blatant example of lazy songwriting. I
mean, really, "Santa Claus Lane"? Where, exactly, is Santa Claus Lane?
If your particular town doesn't have a Santa Claus Lane, does that mean
Santa Claus can't come right down it, and children will wake up Christmas
morning to find nothing but empty stockings and apologies? Or is it like
a carpool lane, a special section of the freeway you can't drive unless
you're a jolly old elf or are accompanied by a jolly old elf? Correct
answer: they made it up, it sounds jaunty. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosty the Snowman</SPAN><BR>
You know what I like about this song? It has an
honest-to-Kringle sad ending. Doomed from the start, Frosty ends up
melting like a Crayola on the dashboard, with only the promise that
he'll come back again someday. It's the <CITE>Empire Strikes Back</CITE>
of Christmas carols. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jingle Bell Rock</SPAN><BR>
I don't know where they get off calling this "rock." It's
not even Jingle Bell Easy Listening. Not a great song in the first place,
this is made even worse by its overinflated sense of hipness. I can just
imagine some sixty-five-year-old crooner saying "And here's one the young
people will enjoy." You want to hear a Christmas rock song? The Kinks,
"Father Christmas," end of story. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Chipmunk Song</SPAN><BR>
 The starkly limited appeal that the chipmunks ever held
for me was hearing hits of the Eighties rendered in their electronically
tortured little voices. (Which is not to say that most Eighties pop stars
didn't themselves have electronically tortured voices.) Given that, I fail 
to see why anyone would be interested in their original compositions. How do
you explain Christ to a chipmunk anyway? <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Little Drummer Boy</SPAN><BR>
There's something charming about this, a song about
the world's first drum solo. It also has a nice little lesson about how
you should give whatever you can. Presumably if the drummer boy didn't
have his drum, he would have given the newborn savior a little shadow
puppet show or something. Me, I would have just asked one of the wise
men if I could put my name on his gift too and pay him back later. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">My Favorite Things</SPAN><BR>
When did this become a Christmas song? I remember
hearing this as part of the infuratingly soothing mall lineup a few
Christmases ago, and since then it's been a minor player in the carol
scene. It has a couple references to mittens and packages and the like,
but it's hardly a seasonal song. Can't we all agree that the Christmas
canon doesn't need adding to? If you're really getting tired of the
usual songs -- and who isn't -- learn "Fum Fum Fum" or "The Wassail Song"
or something. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Grasshoppers</SPAN><BR>
Not the best confection to emerge from the Keebler
Eviscerated Elf Tree. I'm not sure what "elfin magic"
is, but it appears to be essential to making a mediocre version
of Girl Scout Thin Mints. I'd love to see the
Grasshopper-Thin-Mint thing come to blows, because 
it could end up in a no-holds-barred
battle royale between Girl Scouts and cartoon elves, and
who wouldn't want to see that? "Two cookie purveyors enter, one
cookie purveyor leaves." <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chips Ahoy</SPAN><BR>
I distrust all attempts to adulterate the Basic Crunchy Store-Bought
Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I'm disillusioned, for example, by the
number of people who are willing to buy that "soft" store-bought cookies
are "home-style" when a more accudescription would be "oddly grainy." 
Chips Ahoy, to be fair, have shown up in various Bizzarro-cookie
formats over the years, but the original crunchy
break-into-a-million-pieces-in-the-box version abides. Aside from
capturing the very quintessence of chocolate chip cookies, Chips
Ahoy are also finely optimized for the milk-dunking treatment,
absorbing the milk perfectly and only falling to bits just often enough
to keep things interesting. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Barnum Circus Animals</SPAN><BR>
Unlike their enfrosted cousins, these are clearly recognizable 
by species. And as such, they're ideal for that most charming
of childhood rituals: slow meticulous dismemberment. Whether
head-first or feet-first, animal cookies inevitably go through
the sort of torture that makes the movie "Seven" look like a
sunny, family-oriented 50's musical. It's fun! <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pecan Sandies</SPAN><BR>
As cookies, these aren't bad, but they have to lose big points
for the name. Maybe it's just that I live in a beach town, but
"sandy" is not a word I want describing my cookies. Whenever I
eat them, some subconscious portion of my mind is on grit alert.
You can see how that would be unpleasant. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">SnackWell's Chocolate Sandwich Cookies</SPAN><BR>
These have that "dropped a cookie on the car floor, discovered
it a week later, looked it over and decided it was okay to eat
because, hey, who's going to know unless of course you write a
Web page about it" taste. Kind of stale and gross. All in all, I'd
rather eat half as many real cookies -- or even say a quarter-teaspoon of
good quality olive oil -- than these. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Springtime Oreos</SPAN><BR>
I covered Oreos last time, so you may be wondering why I'm touching
on these, when they're the same damned cookie, just with light blue
centers. My point precisely. Are we such mindless consumers that
we're willing to treat Oreos with tinted "stuf" as an entirely
different product? Are we willing to sell out the national attention
span for the price of a couple drops of blue food coloring? Well,
I am, but I was wondering about you. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bra Sizer</SPAN><BR>
This is a device -- perfect for tucking into a purse or utility belt --
which informs one of one's bra size. Clever and all, but I personally
don't wear bras except that one time, and all my female friends know
their bra size already. But I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take
up writing cheap porn: "Rhiannon unbuttoned her clown outfit to reveal
her firm breasts, which were, hold on, let's say 34D." <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Soap</SPAN><BR>
The soap in question came as part of one of those skin care systems that
promise to invigorate your skin and reassure your pores or somesuch. The
problem is that it's clear glycerine soap. Completely colorless. Which
means that in the water it instantly turns invisible, making it incredibly
likely that you'll slip on it and bang your head against your waterproof
radio and as the surgeon cuts into your skull to relieve the swelling
he'll admire your beautiful skin. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Elvis Catalog</SPAN><BR>
Lots of interesting crap in here. Like a cookie jar in the shape of
Elvis, so that you can pretend you're retrieving baked goods from the
torso of the King himself. Like clothing so ugly even Presley wouldn't
wear it, each item nonetheless emblazoned with his signature. Perhaps
the most off-putting is a CD of Looney Tunes characters singing Elvis
songs. I can't bear to imagine what Elmer Fudd singing "Love Me Tender"
must sound like. Oh wait, it'd probably sound a lot like Cyndi Lauper.
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shoe Catalog</SPAN><BR>
Not just your ordinary shoe catalog, this was comprised of shoes
that are a) high-heeled, b) tacky, and c) suspiciously large.
Now, all the models in the catalog were women, but I'm not
sure the majority of the <EM>buyers</EM> are, if you follow me.
But apparently you can't just label your catalog "SHOES FOR
BURLY GUYS IN DRAG" in the current political climate, so they
have to go through the same sad pretense that Playgirl has
been living with for decades. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Light Bulb</SPAN><BR>
At first I was pleased that some light bulb manufacturer had seen
fit to send us a free sample, but the note enclosed informed me that
it was actually the <EM>packaging</EM> that I was supposed to be
impressed with, given that it had protected the light bulb from
the slings and/or arrows of the US Postal Service. So of course
I took this as a personal challenge, put the lightbulb back in 
the package, and proceeded to stomp on it right there in the post
office like some crazed bridegroom at a Jewish wedding. I won.
The package may have stood up to cross-country transport, but it
can't endure the fury of a Shuttlecock. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Druid</SPAN><BR>
Druids are characterized in Dungeons and Dragons as holy folk
who commune with fauna, concern themselves with the balance of
nature, and are just as likely to be found slogging through
lightless dungeons gutting kolbolds as anyone else in the world of
Greyhawk. This satisfies the gamer's need for a character with
an interesting backstory, but one which nevertheless doesn't
get in the way of the usual blood-for-gold-pieces marketplace
of a standard adventure module. But they do have interesting
spells which use vines and things. <B>C+</B>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bard</SPAN><BR>
Just a bad idea overall. In the original AD&D, you had to
go through all sorts of RPG rigamarole to make your character
a Bard, involving switching classes more often than a state
college student switches majors. This is good, because it
reduced the overall number of players carrying lutes and
making up an ode every time you took out another nest of owl-bears.
From what I understand, now you can be a Bard from the get-go.
I shudder to think. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Barbarian</SPAN><BR>
The odd thing to me is that this involved the same detailed level
system as the rest of the classes. There's something odd about
having a "third level Barbarian," as if he had to pass some sort
of Barbaric bar exam to prove his competence to practice 
barbarism in the state of New Jersey. Presumably if you
were ever caught extending your pinky under any circumstances
you were, as it were, disbarred. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ranger</SPAN><BR>
Not ranger in the Smokey the Bear sense, nor even a Ranger in
pickup truck sense, either of which would have been entertaining.
No, these are Rangers in the Tolkienesque sense of squinty-eyed
guys with names like "Matterhorn, Son of Marathon" who gut and eat bugbears for
supper. Real Jack Palance types, if you could have ever gotten
Jack Palance to wear a hat with a feather in it. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Illusionist</SPAN><BR>
This is just a Magic-User with a penchant for phantasm. Not
terribly interesting beyond the fact that at least they're
not called "Magic-Users." It would have been much more interesting
to make them illusionists in the Doug Henning sense of not
actually having any magical powers. Imagine this: the party is
being menaced by a pair of Ochre Hulks or something equally ludicrous.
Thinking quickly, the Illusionist pulls out three rings
which appear to be interlocked. With a tug and a pearly smile,
the Illusionist separates the rings! Then while one of
the Hulks is explaining to the other how he thinks the trick works,
a Fighter sneaks behind and wallops them with his broadsword.
Ta da! <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gauntlet</SPAN><BR>
Say it with me: "Elf needs food badly. Valkyrie shot the
food. Wizard is about to die." Wizard was always about to
die, because Wizard was a big loser. At any rate, the designers
of Gauntlet were among the first to realize that as long as
you don't make them start over with every game, video game players will
pump money into the machine until their joystick hands cramp up.
You didn't get three lives; you got one life. And even if nothing
evil touched you, said life drained away like oil from a '74 
Dodge Dart. Death was inevitable, but so was hitting the change
machine for another roll of quarters. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Joust</SPAN><BR>
Another pioneer of a video truism: it's more fun if you can
"accidentally" kill a dear friend. "Oh, sorry about that, Bill.
I certainly didn't <EM>mean</EM> to come barreling at you like
a chicken from a jet engine testing cannon, whomping you into
nothingness faster than you can say <I>Struthio Camelus</I>.
I was just distracted by a sudden flashback to the time when we
were six and you pushed me off the swing. My bad." It's also
more fun when a game has little flapping sounds, but that one
hasn't endured as well. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sinistar</SPAN><BR>
Okay, maybe I'm getting a bit obscure here, but <EM>man</EM> this was
a freaky game. For those of you who got some sun in the late eighties,
Sinistar was a game where you try to keep evil aliens from building
a big metal face which then hollers at you and tries to eat your
spaceship. Fair enough. But what made this game stand out was
the voice of the evil metal face. When it is first completed,
it says "I <EM>live</EM>!" in this deep foreboding voice that
makes James Earl Jones sound like Shirley Jones by comparison.
And when it roared in pain -- man, first time I heard it
I leapt three feet, repented, and bit hell out of my tongue, all at once. 
It seemed like an okay game, but it was tough on the nerves.
<B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Q*bert</SPAN><BR>
This just goes to show you how easily impressed people can get
with new technology. This was a game so advanced, when you dropped
a quarter in the slot the machine made a <EM>noise like a quarter
being dropped in the slot</EM>. An astounding display of technical
wizardry! Genuine simulated quarter-dropping noises! It's almost as
if you're in a <EM>real</EM> arcade, wasting <EM>actual money</EM>!
It also made a mechanical thump when you dropped your little fuzzy
orange guy off the edge of his video ziggurat. I assume this was
an equally realistic recreation of the noise little fuzzy guys
make when impacting concrete at terminal velocity, but I've
never checked. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Star Wars</SPAN><BR>
This is the one where you attack a wireframe Death Star in
your wireframe X-Wing while a presumably wireframe dead
Obi-Wan provides you with useful digitized wisdom chunks like "Let go."
Letting go, obviously enough, was not a great strategy. This
took a lot of liberty with the Star Wars mythos, giving
us a Death Star where towers sprout up like snail eyestalks and
where the trench is lined with what appear to be big tubes
from a McDonald's Playland. Not to mention that there are multiple
Death Stars, lined up for the plucking like grocery store
cheese samples. But you know, it's fun. You shoot TIE fighters.
They blow up. The Death Star explodes. Han Solo validates you.
Nifty. <B>A</B></P>

 handed out to the last batch of
Korean snack foods, <A HREF="/orderofthecerealunit.html">The Duke
and Duchess of Corn Pop</A> sent me another box of snacks more
carefully tailored to my particular tastes, i.e. nothing squid
flavored. Thus, we have "Grape Fruit Candy," which is notable mostly
for the fact that they refer to grapes as "grape fruit" throughout,
presumably to distinguish it from grape shot, Grape Nuts, and Grape Ape
reruns. But the candy itself is pretty boring. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pico Boy</SPAN><BR>
Now we're getting somewhere. A Pico Boy, presumably, is one one-trillionth
of a boy, just as pico de gallo is one one-trillionth of a de gallo. Well, one
one-trillionth of a boy tastes a lot like a stale cream puff.  Also, a Pico
Boy according to the box is a flower-eating, unicycle-riding,
sweating gnome with pastry on his head. That darned metric system. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Time</SPAN><BR>
The interesting thing about these reasonably tasty vegetable snacks, aside from
the fact that they're named after a fundamental property of the universe,
is that they come with a red packet of something. I should have known this,
as the package features a small cartoon red packet of something with 
Mickey Mouse gloves, but it still came as a surprise. I am now going
to open the packet to see what it is. Wish me luck. [Opens packet.] It's
ketchup. Jesus Christ that weirds me out. <B>B-</B></P>

These are rice cakes. Just like mother used to buy at the health food

This claims to be pumpkin flavored, but the wrapping depicts some sort

this candy is spot on. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gummi Watch</SPAN><BR>
The packaging for the Gummi Watch prominently displays a generic
cartoon "cool kid" in shades and a backwards baseball cap cheerily
licking his wrist. Dutifully I imitated this, sans headgear, only
to discover that gummi substance is not something you want wrapped
around any body part, especially if you've got hair already occupying
that space. And it's not like the thing actually tells time.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Aquarium Candy</SPAN><BR>
Now you can indulge your childhood fantasy of drinking used
fish water! No longer must you go to the local pet store and
gaze longingly at the guppy tank, wishing that the staff would
bend the rules and let you have just one sip! Now you can get
a little rectangular package with fish on it, filled
with eerie blue sugar goop! Sugar goop that will trigger
any adult's gag reflex! It's a dream come true! <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sports Bottle Candy</SPAN><BR>
Same sugar goop, different package. I like this because it's
kind of the anti-candy-cigarette candy. Rather than imitating
the unhealthy habits of adults in a comparatively harmless
fashion, now kids are presumably imitating the active lifestyles
of parents and sports heroes by squeezing congealed tinted corn syrup
into their diminutive gullets. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rain Sticks Bubble Gum</SPAN><BR>
When this culture appropriates something, it really appropriates
the holy living fuck out of it. Rain Sticks are these long wooden
tubes routinely sold at crafts fairs and eco-gatherings. When
you turn them over, little internal beans or whatnot bounce down
the insides and make a noise vaguely similar to rain. They're one
of dozens of supposed ancient American Indian traditions now
cluttering dorm rooms nationwide. And now they're available in 
edible form, with little gum hunklets making the "rain" noise
against the transparent plastic packaging. Coming soon: delicious
Kachina dolls made of sausage! <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rugrats Comic Book Bubble Gum</SPAN><BR>
This is what made me realize that this entire column is just
an online version of third-graders eating bugs on a dare. I just
thoughtfully chewed a piece of gum decorated with pictures of infants
in order to entertain the public at large with my impressions of
the experience. It was dumb. The comics were dumb, the entire concept was
dumb, and the little kids look like victims of some fetal syndrome
or another but I put it in my mouth anyway. Time for some scotch. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tomato</SPAN><BR>
Overkill. Seeing as all but the oddest pizzas are covered with pureed
essence of tomato, actual tomato slices add little to the effect.
This is especially true given that commercial
tomatoes have grown increasingly tough and pale over the
years, as if there were a historic merger of the vegetable and
sports equipment industries circa 1989, resulting in tomato-softball
"synergy." <B>C</B></P> 

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ground Beef</SPAN><BR>
"Sausage? No, no, that's too daring. Pepperoni? No, I wouldn't
want the neighbors to find out. Ham, maybe? What do you think I am, some kind of
radical Bohemian effigy-torching anarchist? No, we're going to
go with good old fashioned ground beef, just like Momma used to
brown. If it's good enough for soup mix casserole recipes, it's
by-God good enough for this weird-ass eye-talian food. What should
we have to drink with this, Bud Dry or Bud Ice?" <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Grated Packet Cheese</SPAN><BR>
I just want to start out by saying that I truly enjoy grated
Parmesan, and if the cheese dust they provided with your to-go
order resembled grated Parmesan in any way other than hue, I'd like
it too. But it doesn't. It tastes like non-dairy cheese-mimicing food product,
and it gives your pizza the same texture as you'd get by leaving
it on the floor of a junior high woodshop class for a good half-hour.
That is, if it were physically possible for pizza to exist in the
presence of junior high school students for more than five minutes.
<B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Garlic</SPAN><BR>
The best advice on cooking I've ever heard is "Any dish can be improved
with the addition of either garlic or chocolate chips." I've tried the
chocolate chip pizza and it lacked something, which leaves this. The
power of garlic on pizza is such that adding garlic to pizza improves it
even if there's <EM>already</EM> garlic on it. I've tested this theory recursively,
adding ever more fresh garlic to my pizza, and I wasn't able to reach the
point of diminishing returns before my mere bodily exhalations started setting the
pizza box on fire.  Damn fine pizza, though. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chicken</SPAN><BR>
The disturbing thing about chicken on pizza is that it usually only shows up
when the pizza shop is creating some sort of ill-conceived International
Pizza of Mystery. The tomato sauce is replaced
by white sauce, Thai peanut sauce, or something equally disturbing. Vegetables
you can only get in upscale grocery stores in the flakier portions of
California are tossed on top of it, and inevitably the crowning glory is chicken,
because there are a lot of lacto-ovo-poultro vegetarians out there who associate
chicken with healthy living, even when it's drowned in cheese and bechamel sauce. 
Now, some of these creations can be pretty good, but that's not the point. The
point is that you can only take pizza so far before it ceases to be pizza and
instead becomes a member of the hors d'oeuvre family. <B>C+</B></P>

This coin features three boats: "Godspeed," "Discovery," and "Susan

they deserve. Now if we can just get a quarter with a ficus tree named

Enshrined on this disturbing piece of hard currency is "The Old Man
of the Mountain," a monument which for all I know may be awe-inspiring
in real life, but which on the back of a quarter looks like lung disease.
Although, really, even if it did look like an old man, that's

A veritable cheat-sheet of state symbols, the South Carolina coin has
packed the state tree, the state flower, the state bird perching on the
state flower, the state nickname which is a reference to the state tree,
an outline of the state, and a star on the outline of the state showing
the state capital, all on a small metal disk you can stick in your pocket
and use to buy Home Run Pies. If you could fit an extended argument over the
confederate flag on it, it would truly have all things South Carolinian. <B>C</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Maryland</SPAN><BR>
The centerpiece of this design is the dome of the Maryland Statehouse
which, I hate to break it to Marylanders, pretty much looks like every
other government dome in the country. I'm told it's wooden and made
without nails, but that's not something you can tell on a quarter,
anyway. It's like putting the world's largest ball of twine on a quarter;
in miniature bas-relief, it's just a picture of a ball of twine. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

The Massachusetts coin also has an outline of the state on it. I could
see Texas doing this, they put the state on everything from gravestones
to Jell-O molds, but Massachusetts has too many islandy bits to be
a Jell-O mold. Anyhow, there's also a picture of a minuteman statue,
which makes for an interesting question: is it a picture of a minuteman
statue, or a picture of a minuteman who just happens to be in the same
pose and outfit as the statue? Or maybe the statue is a statue of the
minuteman on the quarter, done a few years earlier? Not the sort of
question you want to be contemplating while making change at a tollbooth,
but interesting nonetheless. <B>B-</B></P></TD>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Conjunction Junction</SPAN><BR>
Sure it's got the most down-home funk of any children's television tune
since "The Easy Reader Theme Song." But "Conjunction Junction" goes deeper
than that. Haven't we all asked ourselves "What's my function?" Haven't
we all come to the conclusion that "and," "but," and "or" can get us
pretty far? Haven't we all cut loose the sandbags of our dreary, workaday
existence, only to find that the balloon of our spirit won't go any
higher? This song speaks to the humanity within us all, especially that
portion of our humanity which wears a little train conductor's outfit. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Body Machine</SPAN><BR>
This short seems to be an exercise in mixing metaphors with hedonistic
abandon. The body/machine conceit is abandoned almost immediately in
favor of a series of inexplicable similes involving an unrelated series of
professions. Your saliva acts as a bus driver? A tiny skin diver is
responsible for extracting nutrients? Cellulose is the digestive equivalent
of a traffic cop? We can only be grateful they declined to venture
below the small intestine. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No More Kings</SPAN><BR>
Aside from the ocarinas in the backing track, the main appeal of
"No More Kings" is in the parade of impressionistically animated
characters: the identical Puritans, who seem to function as a sort
of hive-mind; the grotesque parody of a King -- who, by the way, must
be over 150 years old by the time he gets a bucket of tea-stained
seawater dumped over his noggin; the "Redcoats" who would be more
accurately called "Puce-bodies; and the oddly smug President Washington.
Speaking of whom, can anyone explain why he's getting his shoe adjusted
by a colonist in the third shot of him? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Elementary, My Dear</SPAN><BR>
One of the difficulties with Schoolhouse Rock overall is that at the
same time that they're educating about one thing, they're introducing
misinformation about another. For instance, in "Elementary, My Dear,"
at the same time that you're learning that 2 times 16 is 32, you're
also learning that lions drove little bumper cars in Genesis. Two
steps forward, one step back. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">7.50 Once a Week</SPAN><BR>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Green Lantern</SPAN><BR>
At first glance, GL seems like the only Superfriend who's up to
Superman levels of power. He can make anything he wants just
by thinking about it, plus he has a snazzy outfit. But then
there's his weakness: yellow. A <EM>primary color</EM>, for 
God's sake! "Big Bird! You have defeated me once again!" 
"Lemon-scented dishwashing liquid! Lo! I am foiled!"
"Marshmallow peeps! <EM>Nooooooo!</EM>" Nice try. But it's a <EM>very</EM>
snazzy outfit. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Apache Chief</SPAN><BR>
A typical Seventies cultural compromise: "We'll include
multicultural heroes in our cartoon series, but we're
going to give them lame powers. No, I mean <EM>really</EM>
lame." Thus, we have Apache Chief, ("Oh, and we're going to
give them stupid names, too") who can grow big. And once he
turned into a bear. That's fine for "Tall Tales of the Pioneers,"
but one would hope for something a little more riveting from
the spandex-and-superpower crowd. His saving grace was that
he had a great magic word, which various Internet sources
list as "Inec CHOCH," "Enek-CHUK," or "Noam CHOMSKY." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hawkman</SPAN><BR>
Hawkman has a good name and a good look, but when the 
Legion of Doom hits town, you have to admit that
he's just basically a guy with wings, and that doesn't
inspire a lot of confidence. Half the
Superfriends can fly already, all of them can do something
else besides, and none of them molt. <B>C-</B></P>
 
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Flash</SPAN><BR>
I like the Flash. Granted, Superman has the speed thing down too,
but it's always nice to have a backup speedster. That's really the
problem with expanding the Superfriends; you really start to double
up on the superpower niches. Then you get eight different people
trying to capture the same bad guy, mitigate the same natural disaster,
or convince the same pre-teen not to chew on styrofoam cup edges,
and the natural jealousy and resentment that follows leads to tension
and the inevitable front-page breakup, with several of the team members
trying to re-form under the name "The 'Friends," which in turn leads
to a long drawn-out trademark infringement suit, alienating the
core fanbase, who turn to marijuana and imported porn comics as a means of
dealing with the crushing disappointment of seeing their idols revealed
as flawed human beings like anyone else, and meanwhile Gorilla Grodd
is dancing on the mayor's head and nobody's doing anything about it. So
you see. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Black Vulcan</SPAN><BR>
Another from the Great Melting Pot of Lame Powers, Black Vulcan's
power was "Whatever we feel like, as long as we make it look
electric-like." For instance, to fly he turned his lower body into
lightning. I don't see how that would propel you, seeing as your lower body
would then be attracted to the ground or any large grounded metal
objects, but if we start questioning the physics of the Superfriends
we're going to have to start with "Isn't Robin chilly in that get-up?"
and that would take up a four-unit elective class by itself. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Firestorm</SPAN><BR>
Technically, Firestorm didn't show up until the "Superfriends"
had become "The Super Powers," but his head's on fire, so that
makes up for it. Firestorm could transform substances into other
substances, as long as they weren't organic, so again we're dealing
with someone who has no power to affect many common household
objects like yams and leather checkbook covers. It would have
been much more entertaining if his weakness was limited to organic
produce, because then we could have had episodes with titles like
"Showdown at the Farmer's Market" and "The Legumes of Doom." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Previews</SPAN><BR>
What I don't understand is why they have maybe two guys tops doing
the voiceovers for previews. Every preview has one of these two guys,
except for the art flick previews with no voiceover where they figure
a few quick shots of people ballroom dancing in period garb and a scene
where an attractive person says "I have always belived...that life was
for the living" will pull you in. Previews are fun, but can't we get
some variety here? How about  Casey Casem? I'll go to any film with Casey
Casem doing the preview voiceover as long as there are no Klumps in it. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ticket Takers</SPAN><BR>
Apparently there's a huge gulf of communication in the six steps between
the box office and the actual door of the movie theater. The invention
of the telegraph, the beeper, and the chat room have done nothing to
bridge this gap, and a small slip of paper with the words "LETHL WPN 5"
remains the only way to prove that you aren't trying to pull a fast one
on United Artists. Still, no skin off my pancreas, and it keeps teenagers
off the streets, wearing bowties, and glowering at the masses. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Food</SPAN><BR>
The biggest change in the delicate balance between the public and
the media conglomerates will come when they invent a device like the
metal-detecting wands they use in airports, only it detects candy
bars. One wave of this thing and suddenly alarms are going off and
you're being relieved of the bag of fun-size Snickers you had cleverly
concealed in your armpit. Will the moviegoing audience be reduced to
those actually willing to pay a 400% markup on gummi bears, or will the
public rise up againsttheir oppressors like the heroes of a painfully
revisionist summer historical drama? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Introductory Snippet</SPAN><BR>
The little poorly-focused, scratch-covered computer animation at the
beginning of the screening telling you to shut the hell up informs
no one. It's like a PSA for movie clods. The guy talking in a normal
tone of voice about his upcoming foosball tourney has obviously made a
conscious personal choice to be a dick. He's probably the same guy who
parks his SUV right on top of the line because he figures you should
get one parking space for every 25K you spend on your vehicle. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Posters</SPAN><BR>
This seems like a pretty recent (circa Gump) development, but these
days every wannabe blockbuster has a poster that goes up maybe a year
before release, attempting to raise interest in a movie with an obscure
tagline like "In Summer 2001, You Will Learn Not To Burn." The main
people excited by these posters are those who know what the hell it's
talking about, which tend to be those who have scoured the
Web and already know the plot and the plots for the two planned sequels,
but it's nice to have the appearance of anticipation at least. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Credits</SPAN><BR>
What I want is a Web page that tells you, with no spoilers, whether to
stay for the credits. I have friends who want to sit through the credits
no matter what, even if it's an animated movie which has twenty-five
people listed for every character including Blinko the Disoriented
Ferret, but the only reason I stay is because sometimes there are
outtakes. Burgess Meredith coming up with thirty different crude ways
to say "have sex," bless my ankles that's entertainment to make even
the most saturnine frat boy smile. <B>C</B></P>

Will someone please explain to Sony that I'm not going to buy their damned mini-discs?
I've had ample time and huge deforestations of magazine ads to help me make up my mind and it's just not going to happen. I will not take them to a club, I will not -- Jesus, I almost went into a Seuss Fugue. <EM>Look what you made me do!</EM> <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">CDs</SPAN><BR>
The acronym is overused but CDs are a lot of fun. They spark when you put them in the microwave, they can be used to make decorative clocks, and I'm pretty sure they fly. Let me try -- yup! Take <EM>that</EM>, Ace of Base! The main drawback is that they look just like CD-ROMs, DVDs, and Playstation games. That's never been an actual inconvenience, but it offends me on an aesthetic level. Different things should look different, dammit. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">LPs</SPAN><BR>
I like vinyl records because they may be the last data storage format that one can experience on a tactile level. Also, there are a bunch of great gags involving vinyl that don't apply to other types of music. Like, you know, when Fred Flintstone or Lucille Ball or whomever is pretending to sing and the record skips and they have to lip-sync the same line over and over? Okay, not <EM>great</EM> gags, but still, what  are you going to get out of a CD? Rainbow humor? <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cassette Tapes</SPAN><BR>
People complain when their tape player sucks up their tape like Lady and/or the Tramp in that one spaghetti scene, but I think it's the best part. There's a very basic satisfaction to be had in yanking audio tape out in handfuls, and I'm always grateful on some level when third-rate technology gives me the excuse. Take <EM>that</EM>, Abba Teens! <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">8-Tracks</SPAN><BR>
I dunno. A lot of people get this whole Starsky/Hutch, Sonny/Cher, Chico/The Man pleasant retro groove from 8-tracks, but I remember them primarily as the medium used by "2-XL," an educational robot from the late Seventies which, I'm convinced, could kick Poo-Chi's ass in a bar fight. The only two 8-track albums I remember were "The Red-Headed Stranger" by Willie Nelson, and "Back Home Again" by John Denver. But those were damn fine albums! <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Henrietta Pussycat</SPAN><BR>
If there's one thing I want to impress upon my readership, it's the
importance of context. A middle-aged man with a hand-puppet going "Meow
meow love meow meow meow friends" in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe:
beloved children's icon. A middle-aged man with a hand-puppet going "Meow
meow love meow meow meow friends" at the bus stop: a good reason to give
undivided attention to your crossword puzzle. I found it particularly
eerie that she could only speak English about once every five words;
the rest was "meow." It was like the inverse of the Smurf language. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lady Elaine Fairchilde</SPAN><BR>
The thing about childhood is that nothing makes sense. You have no
idea what half the jokes on sitcoms are about, Bugs Bunny keeps making
references to WWII-era European dictators you don't recognize, and Hot
Wheels always manage to go around the loop-the-loop just fine on the
commercials. So you just relax and go along with it, and fifteen years
later you look back on the things that confused you and say "Ah! Yes! It
makes perfect sense now!" Except in the cases, like Lady Elaine,
where you don't. I still don't get Lady Elaine. Was she related to that
Madam marionette? Or was she some sort of ground-breaking transgendered
hand-puppet? Why did she live in the Pantheon? She was about the only
one with a mean streak; I really think she would have been happier as
a Muppet, where she could have blown things up and hit people. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mr. McFeely</SPAN><BR>
I really try to avoid commenting on the sexual implications of character
names. Such jokes are usually pretty obvious and adolescent. Watch
Mr. Roger's Neighborhood with some fourteen-year-olds and you'll get all
the "Henrietta Pussycat" gags you can stand. However, it's impossible to
ignore in this case. Come on, The guy's name is "Mr. McFeely"! It sounds
like a Butthole Surfers album! So here goes: Boy, that "Mr. McFeely"
certainly could "hand-deliver" those "packages." He certainly knew
how to "ring the bicycle bell." I wonder if he ever made "overnight
deliveries"? There. Glad to have that out of my system. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Trolley</SPAN><BR>
I've come to the realization that the Trolley is the god of the animistic
Religion of Make-Believe. It creates and unmakes their universe. It comes
and goes like a comet, on an agenda of its own. Nobody may understand
it, they may only fear it. Oh, yes, they treat it with the same open
friendliness that they treat every face-painted vagrant that comes
their way, but that's because in their souls they understand one law:
don't piss off the Trolley. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bob Dog</SPAN><BR>
Bob Dog is dead now, gone to the Happy Education Grounds to frolic with
Mr. Hooper. So sad. No longer will he put on doggy makeup and and floppy
fabric ears and go "Bowowowowow" to the delight of children and the
unemployed. He probably had training in Shakespearean theatre. People
who end up playing housepets on children's television shows always have
Shakespearean training. I took some theater arts classes in college,
but thank Bacchus I never took any Shakespeare classes or I'd probably be
"Boomer the Kitty Klown" on cable access somewhere. <B>C-</B></P>

too. The coin also has the phrase "Crossroads of the Revolution" imprinted
on it. Presumably this is part of some desperately
overextended metaphor: "In New Jersey, the Crossroads of the Revolution,
Washington was forced to contemplate whether to blow through the Yellow

turn it upside down, looks something like a butt. Now I, personally,
am above such juvenile shenanigans, preferring to get my butt images from
alt.binaries.pictures.rude.subliminal.heinies, but I'm just
glad that our nation's schoolchildren will have an outlet for cheap
currency-based laughs, given that the new one-dollar bills coming out
will probably no longer be able to be folded so that Washington looks
like a penis. <B>B</B></P></TD></TR>

I'm not thrilled with this design depicting early Delawarian Caesar
Rodney. First, "Caesar Rodney" sounds like the stage name of a sitcom
comedian.  Secondly, there are no known portraits of him, meaning that
this is just the coin equivalent of a police sketch. ("Have you seen
this patriot?") Thirdly, the horse looks like it's coming to a humorous
screeching cartoon stop. To his credit, though, Rodney's claim to fame
is apparently that he rode to vote for independence in spite of suffering
from facial cancer. Which explains the lack of portraits. <B>D</B></P></TD></TR>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pennsylvania</SPAN><BR>
"VIRTUE LIBERTY INDEPENDENCE" is emblazoned on this coin.  This is a
bit of a downer: what's the point of liberty and independence if you're
going to hang on to your virtue? I'd prefer "LIBERTY, INDEPENDENCE,
GOOD-NATURED CAROUSING."  Also, the gossamer-gowned statue depicted
is supposed to extending her right hand in a gesture of mercy. If this
is true, then the international gesture of mercy looks a lot like the
gesture I use when I want someone to hand me the Doritos bag from the
floor because I'm too lazy to get up and get it myself. <B>C-</B></P></TD></TR>

<p class="ratingheader">Resolutions</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The interesting thing about New Year's Resolutions is that the flaws
they address are usually most in evidence during the holidays; eating
too much, drinking too much, spending too much money, yelling at your
family, making out with a coworker behind the ficus at an office party,
that sort of thing. It's a handy arrangement--when looking for ways to
shore up your personality, you only have to consider the past three or
four weeks. This also explains why so few New Year's Resolutions involve
sculling, tanning, or sand castles. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Auld Lang Syne</p>
<p class="ratingbody">It's always funny to hear people sing Scots poetry while wearing
shiny hats. I usually try to get everyone to launch into "<a
href="http://www.robertburns.org/works/333.shtml">Johnie Lad, Cock Up
Your Beaver</a>" to the tune of "Puff the Magic Dragon" as an encore,
but by then everyone's putting on coats and calling babysitters so
it's never really gotten the ensemble treatment it deserves. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Kissing at Midnight</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad to see that this tradition hasn't gone the route of mistletoe.
You don't have to kiss everyone who asks, or whichever random
partygoer happens to have sidled over to you, you just traditionally
kiss anyone with whom you're in an established or incipient kissing
relationship. Having said that, it's not so much a tradition as "the
obvious thing to do." It's midnight, you've been drinking, and you're
with someone with whom you share a relationship and/or birth control
responsibilities.  What else are you going to do? Shake hands? Notarize
documents? <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Noisemakers</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Making a lot of noise at midnight is supposed to ward off evil
spirits. Just like partially every other ancient tradition, from saying
"Gesundheit" to watching the Super Bowl for the commercials. It would
have been interesting to live back in historical times where people
apparently felt that evil spirits were ubiquitous, yet excruciatingly
timid. If using a fifty-cent cardboard horn to make a duck noise scares
off evil spirits for an entire year, I figure putting up a small sign
saying "EVIL SPIRITS WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER'S EXPENSE" should keep them
out of my hair for a decade or so. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Standing on a Chair and Eating Grapes</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I found this "tradition" mentioned in only one place on the entire
Web. I must admit, however, that I haven't looked very hard. This
is because I want to believe. In my heart I want there to be people,
many thousands of people, who mark the passing of the old year
and the coming of the new by standing on a chair and eating grapes.
I won't be doing it myself, of course, it's way too goofy, but
I'd be very happy to know that other people are doing it. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve</p>
<p class="ratingbody">"Rockin'" has become one of those terms that have come to mean
the absence of what they describe, like "extreme" and
"perfectly legal." Anything described as "rockin'"
is nearly guaranteed not to rock. Case in point, there is perhaps
nothing less rockin' to do with your New Year's Eve than to
turn on the television and watch other people having a party.
Particularly if Rod Stewart's on the bill. Rod Stewart was last 
reported rocking in 1988, and even then it was an unreliable witness
with a malfunctioning camera. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Nunchuks</SPAN><BR>
These were the weapon of choice for misanthropic
youths with rich fantasy lives in my junior high.
They didn't actually fight with them of course --
that would have involved wonking themselves on the
head repeatedly -- but they <EM>owned</EM> a pair.
Or more. The reason for this, I suspect, is simply
that while hardware stores don't have a "ninja sword"
section, they do carry chain, dowels, and black paint.
<B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Throwing Stars</SPAN><BR>
These combine the mystery of ninja death-dealing with
the free-wheeling fun of Frisbee, a classic 
chocolate-and-peanut-butter situation. ("You got
Shogun on my Frisbee! You got Frisbee in my
Shogun!") They also great for the movies, because
they require no special effects, or skill on
the part of the thespian-cum-assassin. Shot one:
Ninja throws throwing stars. We hear a "Thwip thwip thunk thunk" sound.
Shot two: Victim has been punctured and/or pinned 
to the wall by his clothes. It makes "Bewitched" look like
a special-effects spectacular by comparison. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Oreo-O's</SPAN><BR>
All right, this isn't a ninja weapon. It is, rather, a breakfast cereal.
But, I'm not going to be doing another cereal rating for a few weeks,
and I wanted to get the word out now. This stuff is just insane. It's
mind-cloudingly wonderful. It's a breakfast cereal that tastes <EM>just
like Oreos!</EM> It's uncanny! You pour it in the bowl, you add milk,
and boom, you're eating Oreos. It <EM>looks</EM> a little weird -- the
O's are dark brown with little flecks of "Stuf," like a film negative of
Apple Jacks -- but it's just indescribably fantastic. I have a history
of falling in love with cereals that get pulled off the market shortly
thereafter ("Smurfberry Crunch" comes to mind), so I advise you to get
it while you can, stockpiling it militia-style if necessary.  <B>A+.</B>
Okay, back to the ninjas.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Long Chains With a Hook at the End</SPAN><BR>
This seems a little unnecessarily complicated for ninja,
the masters of the "hide, strike, fade into the night" triathlon.
Change that to "hide, jump out, throw a chain so that it wraps
around your opponent's legs, yank them toward you, poke them 
with a hook a few times, <EM>then</EM> fade into the night" and
you've lost a lot of the mystique. Add to that the fact that in
the movies, characters normally only get the whole chain routine so
that the filmmaker can show that the character can defeat even the
dreaded chain, which would be impressive except for the fact that
the dreaded chain never seems to do much. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Swords</SPAN><BR>
Oh, I'm sure there are all sorts of names for all
sorts of swords that your better ninja might be carrying,
but they're all ninja swords, and that's what's important.
Swords are the second-most-important aspect of ninja cinema,
right after those little footy socks with the big toe
in its own little section. You whack them with the sword,
then you kick them with the footy sock; it's all part of
the plan. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Smoke Bombs</SPAN><BR>
I'm a fool. This Rating had been posted only a couple hours
before a reader identified only as "Nutas McGrootas" pointed out
that in the abovementioned hierarchy of ninja equipment, I had
completely left out the number one most important ninja item:
the smoke bomb. And goshdamnit, he's right. Even with your sword
and your footy socks, you just aren't a ninja without your
smoke bombs. You can't get in the ninja clubs, you don't get your
10% ninja discount at Denny's and you can't invest pre-tax income
in the ninja 401(k) plan. Thanks, Nutas, for pointing out my
sad oversight. <B>A</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Thor</SPAN><BR>
Very different from the Fabioesque Marvel superhero, the
original Thor defined macho centuries before muscle cars and 
chaps even existed. We're dealing with a being who owned
magical goats which he slaughtered and ate every night.
The next day they came back to life, he'd have them
pull his divine cart for a while, then he'd <EM>eat 'em
again!</EM> This is an entity who lost only one drinking 
contest is his entire existence, and then only because
as it turned out he was drinking the entire sea and didn't
realize it. Not big on perception skills, but he sure
could hold his liquor and/or seawater. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Loki</SPAN><BR>
Having earned a B.A. in literature from a California
university, I've attended more lectures on The Trickster
Figure in Myth than I care to recall. You've got Coyote,
Eshu, The Great Gazoo, the list goes on and on. And then
you've got Loki. "Trickster figure" doesn't even begin to
cover it. You think trickster, you think practical jokes, 
shoplifting, maybe some tagging. You don't tend to think
of leading the legions of hell in battle against
the gods at the end of the universe, but that's exactly
what Loki's got jotted down in his celestial Palm Pilot.
Also he's fathering illegitimate monsters with a giantess
in his off hours. Heavy. <B>B+</B></P>


<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Balder</SPAN><BR>
The god of love, purity, beauty, blah blah blah. Balder's
mom was worried about him, so she got all objects in the
universe to swear they'd never kill him, which is pretty
obsessive. Unfortunately for some reason she 
overlooked a mistletoe tree, and so Balder suffered the 
godly and heroic death of a mistletoe sprig through the heart.
Then the goddess of death agreed to give him back if everything
in the universe wept for him. Which everyone did except for
Loki. Moral of the story: there's always someone to fuck anything
up. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Freya</SPAN><BR>
This is the one you always forget when you try to remember
who the days are named after. She got Friday named after her,
so somewhere in the universal unconscious she's forever associated
with three-day-weekends. She had sex with four dwarfs in exchange for a 
necklace. She has a lover named Ottar who is disguised as a wild boar.
She once appeared on "Love Connection" and got a date with Hank from
Detroit. Two of the previous three sentences are accurate. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ymir</SPAN><BR>
Dead giant. Ymir is responsible for some of the most unappetizing
aspects of the Norse mythos. To begin with, humanity emerged from
his armpit. This is not a madcap comedy from the makers of "Dumb and Dumber,"
this is actual ancient myth. Later on, after he's dead, the human-habitable
portion of reality is formed from his eyebrow. So if you wonder why
the gods no longer commune with us, there's your explanation. We are
armpit sweat living on a giant dead eyebrow. <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>1/2</B><BR>
One-half seems like a powerful fraction in a democratic society, but when you think about it, it's actually the source of political paralysis.  At best, one-half leads to recounts, revotes, and backroom deals.  At worst, it leads to magazine headlines like "Deadlock in Washington: Will The US Survive?" The most powerful fraction in a democracy is "a number exactly one unit over one-half," but it doesn't fit on your calculator screen.  <B>C</B></P>

<P><B>Pi</B><BR>
Pi, by and large, is very useful, but there is this ridiculous obsession with finding the nth digit of Pi, where n is stupid.  A value of pi that's accurate to the 31st digit is good enough to measure the circumference of the entire universe within one proton, so anything beyond that is bordering on the -- please forgive the coinage -- mathsturbatory.  <B>C-</B></P>

<P><B><I>i</I></B><BR>
There are two types of imaginary numbers: those which are imaginary just like those stories in Action Comics where Superman marries Jimmy Olsen and moves to Laguna Beach, and those which are imaginary in the mathematical sense of "hard to explain to your parents." The former includes numbers like "fourteen gazillion billion gazillion" and the latter includes <I>i</I>, a number which is equal to the square root of -1.  While I have nothing but respect and tolerance for fourteen gazillion billion gazillion, I admire <I>i</I> for actually being the right answer sometimes.  <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Zero</B><BR>
The invention of zero must have led to conversations reminiscent (or rather, prescient) of an Abbott and Costello routine.  "I just invented an important mathematical concept!" "What is it?" "Nothing!" "Don't be modest, tell me what it is." "Nothing!" "Then what did you interrupt me for?" "Nothing!" No, that never happened, I just made it up.  It's not even plausible.  Forget I said it.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><B>Three</B><BR>
I like three, which is a problem because whenever you tell someone you like the number three they think you've got some sort of mythical-cum-religious reason for it, like you're into the Holy Trinity or the Fates or Wilson Philips.  In reality, I like the way it sounds when you yell it: "Threeeeeeee!" <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lollipop Paint Shop</SPAN><BR>
An entry from the Lik-M-Aid school of thought, this combines a lollipop "paintbrush" with powdery "paint." What precisely you're supposed to be painting is left unclear, but it did a passable job of tinting my tongue. The effect was more like wood stain than paint, but I imagine "Wood Stain Candy" would have been tough to bring to market. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ouch! Bubble Gum</SPAN><BR>
Tragic and disappointing. The box is shaped like a tin of Band-Aids, the individual gum wrappers have a little Band-Aids pictured on them, and when you open them up, what do you get? Plain old run-of-the-mill bubble gum with no properties in common with Band-Aids except possibly shelf life. It's just stupid. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Candy Cigarettes</SPAN><BR>
These appear to be no longer available in my part of the country. Presumably this is because of the increasingly negative public opinion of tobacco, but maybe they were found to be a link to cancer of the sweet tooth or something. While a sad loss, there's always dried spaghetti for kids who want to pretend to smoke, and the candy itself was nothing to write a screen saver over. The flavor is best described as "curiously weak peppermint." <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Candy Blox</SPAN><BR>
These are Lego-shaped, though sadly not Lego-intercompatible, chunks of confection. The idea is that you create a little blocky sculpture and then you eat it, thus underscoring the ineffable "nowness" of art. The thing I love about these is that it's are the only food item I know of with big lettering on the front saying "CHOKING HAZARD." Appetizing! <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Candy Rings</SPAN><BR>
Even through the decades, as I've grown from a young lad in Luke Skywalker underwear to a mature adult in Darth Maul underwear, one thing has remained true: candy rings really pinch. Now,of course, I have to slip it on my pinky like some Candyland mafioso, but it still bites like a mother. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Paper Clips</SPAN><BR>
The paper clip was invented nearly a century ago. Since then,
there have been all sorts of pretenders to the paper clip throne;
plastic triangle clips, Garfield-shaped clips, little tiny binder clips. And yet
none of them are any true threat to the ascendancy of the lowly
metal paper clip, and for an obvious reason: you can't make bendy
shapes out of them. The ability to make bendy shapes at work is
intrinsic to the functioning of high-powered American businesspersons
everywhere; whether animals, sproingy jumping things, or just
abstract expressionist sculpture, bendy paper clip shapes are what 
hold this country together.
<B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ballpoint Pens</SPAN><BR>
Most offices are smart enough not to stock the really good pens.
They know that you can give away coffee, pads of paper, floppy disks,
and even low-end computer systems, but the minute you start to
stock nice rollerball pens in an unlocked cabinet, they'll march
on out of there at a rate that would bring the strongest corporation
to its metaphorical knees. Valuable stock has fallen precipitously
on the mere <EM>rumor</EM> that a company is about to start stocking good pens.
So instead, you get crappy, blotchy, smeary ballpoints in black, red,
and -- if you work for a really off-beat, feel-good company -- blue.
<B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">White-Out</SPAN><BR>
White-Out is not quite as important around the office as it used
to be -- who uses a typewriter anymore? -- but it's still
symbolically vital. It's common knowledge that the mother of former "Monkee" Mike Nesmith
became very wealthy as a result of inventing and patenting
the formula for White-Out. It just goes to show that anyone in 
this country can, with sufficient ingenuity and a go-get-it spirit, 
make it rich <EM>and</EM> give birth to a pop star. And isn't that
what we all aspire to? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Graph Paper</SPAN><BR>
Some people like your standard 8.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;11 ruled paper.
Others prefer yellow legal paper for its extra doodle space. Me,
I like graph paper. It's great for your basic writing, making it
easy to line up indents in a snappy manner; it's great for graphs,
of course, and I graph things for the heck of it more often than I care to
admit; and it's really great for doodling along the lines to see
what things would have looked like on a late-Seventies video game
system. And there's always the pleasure of impromptu Battleship.
<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Binders</SPAN><BR>
I can see why people might like binders; I prefer unruly stacks. Binders
remind me too much of Junior High, to begin with, and a lot of them
seem like they could take off a couple fingers if you closed the loops
the wrong way. At least in Junior High you had your choice of overexposed
media characters and/or unnecessarily enthusiastic sports slogans on
your binder. At the office you generally get a couple dark shades of
conventional. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Staple Removers</SPAN><BR>
Yet another entry in the fun-but-not-for-what-it's-meant-for race.
I think I've used a staple remover to remove actual staples maybe
twice in my life. I generally just rip the sheets right off the stack; I'm
heartless that way. But I love staple removers anyway, because they represent
one of the few times in life that your employer will supply you with a working
hand puppet. Don't get me wrong; I don't sit and talk out load to my 
staple remover.  No, I just silently <EM>pretend</EM> it's talking. 
Or sometimes I use it to threaten the phone. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><A HREF="http://www.thespot.com">The Spot</A></SPAN><BR>
Back before the Spot, Web-wide world was divided as to whether we
should use these new-fangled "background gif" and "table" features on our
Web pages, or stick with minimal markup, which would allow even blind
people to find out how much we like They Might Be Giants. Along came
The Spot, which proved once and for all that by giving the big finger
to the blind, you could attract sighted geeks by the bargeload. This
was accomplished by having fictional women in bikinis write about
their personal lives in large fonts with orange backgrounds. So you
can see it was an important step in the evolution of the Web. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><A HREF="http://www.spinnwebe.com/dfc/">The Dysfunctional Family Circus</A></SPAN><BR>
The entire purpose of this column, actually, is to provide a link
to this seminal (in the literal sense of being full of semen) Web
page. The DFC was devoted to the proposition that The Family
Circus is much funnier if you assume that someone is always having
kinky sex off-panel, and who can argue with that? At any rate,
the DFC got the Barrister Smackdown from Keane and Co., so check it
out before it's all over. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><A HREF="http://www.mirsky.com">Mirsky's Worst of the Web</A></SPAN><BR>
A sort of primordial weblog, this site once linked to three or four pages
that were generally so bad it made your monitor curdle. So if you're
wondering why all monitors these days come with anti-curdle defractors,
that's why. You might wonder why you'd <EM>want</EM> to be directed to bad
pages, but this was before Geocities made bad home pages a buyer's market. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bobaworld</SPAN><BR>
This page, now lost forever as far as I can tell, was inexplicably popular back in the day. (Sept 23, 1995) It
took pandering to newbies to an entirely new level, going so far as
to explain how to move and click your mouse, as if people would have
gotten to the page in the first place by random quantum arrangement of
electrons. The popularity may have been explained in part by a glowing
endorsement from Rodney Dangerfield. The Web was really hard up for
celebrity endorsement back then. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><A HREF="http://www.eveander.com/">The Garden of Eden</A></SPAN><BR>
Eve Astrid Andersson was the original Hot Web Babe, based on the fact that
she was female, had a Web page, and had memorized hundreds of digits of
pi. Andersson's star has been eclipsed, sadly enough, by the hundreds of
pay-per-peek Web sites with "cam" in the name, but know that there was
once a time when a woman's attractiveness on the Web was measured not
by how much skin she flashed at her QuickCam, but by how many numbers she
could stuff into her brain at once. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Noisemakers</SPAN><BR>
Nothing says "I'm having fun" like two or three dozen people
simultaneously producing a noise like a sexually satisfied duck. Our
ancestors actually had to sexually satisfy ducks to produce this effect,
and on New Year's they had to do it simultaneously, so it's no surprise
that someone came up with a simpler method. The luridly unrolling paper
appendage only adds to the ambiance. For children's parties, though,
I think someone should invent the whitenoisemaker, so that hyperactive
school-age soiree attendees can soothe parents with the gentle sound of
the ocean's surf. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hats</SPAN><BR>
Nothing also says "I'm having fun" like a pointy paper hat, a great way to 
fulfill the three Ls of party-enjoyment-experiencing: "(L)ook stupid,"
"(L)eave little red marks on your face from the elastic band," and "Have 
something to throw up in, (L)arry." Your extremely clever party-goer will
occasionally wear the hat as a makeshift beak, adding to the festive mood 
and demonstrating his or her concern for the plight of the rare-but-majestic
Cone-beaked Drizzly Egret. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Squirt Guns</SPAN><BR>
While I could see these being excellent for a black-tie debutante ball
for the ambassador's daughter, the fact is that they're most often handed
to the grubby-fingered Kool-Aid-swilling guests at a kids' party. This is
a bad idea. Even if it's a pool party it's a bad idea, because the first
thing that goes through your average child's mind when presented with
a squirt gun is "Where's the cat?" followed by a search for those with
casts or nice pants suits. After all, what's the point in soaking anyone
who's already wet or willing to become so? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cup and Ball Games</SPAN><BR>
A cup-and-ball game is interesting for exactly as long as it takes for
you to get the ball into the cup. Then you're proven your point and you're
ready to move on. Which means it can be minutes of fun for the truly
maladroit, but at that point they'd probably be just as challenged and
entertained by the can opener. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Little Plastic Bottles That Explode When You Pull The String</SPAN><BR>
I think they're supposed to be champagne bottles, but that doesn't

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Walrus is an Ancient Viking Symbol for Death</SPAN><BR>
Oh, please. Can you imagine a bunch of Vikings coursing their way through
the frigid Nordic waters, looking into the dense fog with trepidation beginning
to form across their brows, when suddenly one of them sees: The
Black Walrus! The Walrus of Death! That Undiscovered Walrus From Whose
Bourne No Traveler Returns! It sounds distinctly Pythonesque. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Green Apple on the LP Turns Blood Red Underwater</SPAN><BR>
This is astoundingly cool, except for the bit where it's a complete
lie. When I first heard this one, I leapt up to test it,
and ended up with nothing more than a wet Abbey Road. For the record
it doesn't work on CD's either, and you really don't want to try
it on 8-tracks. Still, if some musician out there perfects the technology 
to turn a green apple blood red on an LP underwater, I 
swear right here that I will buy your album, no matter how bad it is.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">"Lovely Rita Meter Maid" Refers to Paul's Car Crash</SPAN><BR>
The theory here is that Paul's fatal car accident was caused by
him being distracted by an attractive meter maid at an inopportune
moment. Boy, those mop tops are gruesome, aren't they? Not only do
they plant various lyrical clues referring to heads flying off and teeth 
flying out and hair catching on fire, they go ahead and write
an entire song devoted to the agent of Paul's untimely demise.
Makes Nick Cave look like "Peter, Paul, and Mommy" by comparison. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Drum on "Sgt. Pepper" Spells Out "HE DIE" if you Use a Mirror</SPAN><BR>
Ooh! Spooky! And unlike the Blood Apple, this one actually works. Oh,
sure, what it spells looks more like |ONE|X HE|DIE, but the "HE DIE" is
in there, which can be quite unnerving if it's night and 
you've been reading about severed heads and disembodied 
teeth for a couple hours. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">I Buried Paul</SPAN><BR>
I'm led to understand that the second Beatles Anothology album proves
once and for all that John was in fact singing "cranberry sauce," which
alone is a good enough reason to spend thirty bucks on a bunch of songs
you've heard before.  What remains unanswered, however, is the question
of what the hell did he mean by "cranberry sauce"? Do British people
even eat cranberry sauce? I thought it was a uniquely American dish,
consumed once a year as penance for slavery and inventing the sitcom.
It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma and digitally remastered. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mute</SPAN><BR>
I can't bring myself to trust mute,  no matter how steadfastly the
little red light shines. I've been raised on too many sitcoms not to
expect mute buttons, microphone off switches, and office door locks to
fail whenever it leads to  hilarious levels of social awkwardness. It's
the same reason I don't dress up in a disguise to make sure my girlfriend
isn't cheating on me, only to bungle the attempt and in the process ruin
the surprise party she had planned for my birthday.o <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Redial</SPAN><BR>
This is another  button that can be awkward, because you can hit redial to
invite a friend to catch a movie, but you forgot that you tried to call
your own mother a half-hour ago, and this time she answers the phone,
and you end up asking "who's this?" before realizing what you did, so you
can't play it cool and you didn't want to talk to her right now anyway
and anyway the movie's going to start real soon so you have to tell your
mom you don't want to talk to her or you'll miss the movie and if you're
lucky you'll drop into some sort of coma before you get that far. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Emergency Dial</SPAN><BR>
I think I can remember "911" by myself, thanks. usually the phone comes
with three emergency buttons, and I can't even think of two other numbers
that I'd need to call in an emergency situation. I guess I could call
the correct time, I always found the time lady's voice kind of soothing,
maybe that would help. And I could also call my friend Lindy, because
she's never home and has an answering machine, so I could leave cool
last words for future generations to treasure. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Memory Dial</SPAN><BR>
I never use memory dial. This is because I am so lazy that I can't even
be bothered to put in the effort to set up effort-conserving devices. Getting
memory dial to work  would involve working out my phone number priorities
in detail, finding the phone instructions, looking up each number in my PDA,
hell, it's too tedious to even finish talking about it. Modern
phones have lifespans so short that, if they were breeding organisms,
they'd have to give birth to hundreds of phonelings just to keep the
species going, so it just doesn't seem worth it. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flash</SPAN><BR>
This is much less exciting than it sounds. Phones could flash in so many
interesting ways that it's a pity they use  the word to mean "hang up then
stop hanging up real  quick-like." I understand this feature is real handy for those with call waiting, but my loathing for call waiting is so great that
I consider that a negative, kind of like pointing  out that a given dog
food can also be used to raise giant infectious death geckos. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lit Buttons</SPAN><BR>
A great feature, so great that it shouldn't be considered a feature, but
rather a basic expectation. Since I have to buy a new phone about every
six months -- I assume this is because about 1983 phone manufacturers
started building phone  wiring out of atom-thin strands of gossamer
moonlight -- I sometimes accidentally get one  without a lit face, and
I am consternated in much the same way that I would be if I bought the
one car that didn't have "Comes with a driver's seat!" in the ad. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Who Went To Market</SPAN><BR>
The tragically anonymous author of "This Little Piggy (The Toe-Wiggling
Rhyme)" certainly knew how to draw the reader in. Immediately we're
presented with the intriguing image of a piggy -- a <EM>little</EM> piggy --
going to market. Why would a piggy go to market? And how?
Is it supporting local merchants or taking advantage of the chain stores'
low prices? The scene is set. The die is cast. The pig, as they say,
is shopping. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Who Stayed Home</SPAN><BR>
Immediately our attention is ripped away and fastened to another
pig entirely. The sharp contrast between the piggy-at-market and the
piggy-at-home evokes the Apollonian/Dionysian split, at least among those
of us who took Literature classes in community college. But is it too
much, too soon? By eschewing traditional narrative in favor of a series
of allegorical tableaus, isn't the author robbing us of the chance to
understand the piggies <EM>qua</EM> piggies? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Who Had Roast Beef</SPAN><BR>
At last we reach, you'll please restrain from tracking me down and sneering
at me for saying, the meat of the story. In a single master-stroke, in
the vivid juxtaposition of meat animal and meat, the author manages to
create the most compelling yet disturbing nursery rhyme image since
four-and-twenty blackbird corpses started singing. Eat your heart out,
George Orwell. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Who Had None</SPAN><BR>
At this point the Muse seems to have taken the last Greyhound out of
town and the poet is left to try and pull together the frayed edges of
the work into a completed opus. If this were a modern nursery rhyme,
the author might have been able to transcend the tyrannical paradigm of
songs with "endings," and two toes would have been left unpinched in the
name of Art. Instead, the author employs a cheap parallel to the piggy who
did <EM>not</EM> go to market by sticking us with a piggy who did <EM>not</EM>
eat roast beef.  <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The One Who Went "Wee Wee Wee"</SPAN><BR>
From a critical standpoint, the <EM>denouement</EM> of the piggy saga
leaves much to be desired. To begin with, a previous line already ended
with "home." But truly great poets are able to create a resonant whole
from the most unlikely parts, and so it with with "This Little Piggy."
For all the flaws, the work illuminates a universal human truth: grabbing
someone's pinky toe and going "wee wee wee" is fun. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><strong>Extra Cheese</strong><BR>
<em>Extra</em> cheese? If you need <em>extra</em> 
cheese on your pizza, either a) the pizza service you patronize 
is made up of a bunch of skimping dairy-misers and you 
should find yourself another pizza source, or b) your dietary 
needs would better be served by simply eating a bowl of hot 
cheese. <strong>C-</strong></P>

<P><strong>Pepperoni</strong><BR>
Violently, tragically overrated. I'm convinced that the 
pepperoni tradition was begun by early pizza guys who wanted 
to foist the cheap, vile sausage off on the unknowing early 
pizza patrons, saving the good stuff for cute girls and especially 
heart-wrenching urchins. <strong>C</strong></P>

<P><strong>Sausage</strong>
<BR>Now <EM>this</EM> is a meat topping. If you get it at a 
good place, which is to say a place where you can distinguish 
the pizza crust from the refrigerator magnet that came with it, 
it can be a truly rich and rewarding food experience. And if 
not, it still beats hell out of the bright red grease-saucers they 
call pepperoni. <strong>B</strong></P>

<P><strong>Pesto</strong>
<BR>Are you <em>ready</em> for pesto? Can you 
<em>handle</em> pesto? I've seen strong men 
<em>crumble</em> before a good pesto pizza, begging and 
<em>drooling</em> to be allowed another bite! 
<em>Writhing</em> in the <em>torture</em> of pure basil 
ecstasy! You're <em>afraid</em>, aren't you? <em>You fear 
pesto! Bastard! Coward! Bastard!</em> <strong>A-</strong></P>

<P><strong>Little Red Pepper Flakes</strong>
<BR> Man, I love these. You know, the ones in the big shake-jar 
next to the Parmesan powder? You shake them all over your 
pizza slice and they taste like an invading pizza army. It's like 
eating pizza sacked by Ostrogoths. <strong>B</strong></P>

<P><strong>Anchovies</strong>
<BR>Let's give fish particles their due, shall we? They're not 
really very good tasting, but they serve the dual purposes of 
being a funny topping and being the topping nobody orders. 
Say you're telling a joke, and the guy in the joke orders a pizza. 
Just put anchovies on the pizza and it doubles the comedy, if 
it's a pretty pathetic joke in the first place.</p>

<P>As for the second point, the fact is that there has to be one 
topping that nobody orders, and if there wasn't anchovies, the 
entire Canadian Bacon market would vanish and Canada itself 
would collapse into ruin, forcing us to send them billions of 
dollars in aid just to keep the "For Better or For Worse" 
cartoons coming. <strong>B+</strong></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frogs</SPAN><BR>
Normally you wouldn't expect a plague of frogs to convince
Pharaoh to let the cat out, much less free thousands of slaves,
but imagine this: you wake up one morning, get out of
bed and -- SPLORCH -- step on a frog. Freshly dead amphibian
ichor between your toes <EM>first thing in the morning.</EM>
Pretty <EM>icky,</EM> huh? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Locusts</SPAN><BR>
Not bad. Locusts are horrid little insects, plus they eat crops.
It's two great plagues that plague great together. One wonders,
though, if the frogs ate locusts or if the two plagues had a truce
like that time G.I. Joe and Cobra had to team up to fight
a common enemy. Didn't think I'd be able to work 80's cartoon
shows into this one, did you? <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Blood</SPAN><BR>
A river of blood. Creepy. But in the end it sounds better than, say, a
river of motor oil, syringes and abandoned shopping carts. At least blood
is organic. Still I can see how when you've got a majorly river-based
economy going, it could be difficult to make a transition to a massive
blood-flow economy. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hail</SPAN><BR>
This is about when you realize you really are dealing with
God and not just tough luck and weird weather patterns. Hail,
okay, fine, you just do the ancient Egyptian equivalent of 
rolling up the car windows. But fire <EM>and</EM> hail in tandem
is a big-ass clue that perhaps you're dealing with the chosen
people and maybe you should just let them go and build your
own damn stone monuments. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Death of Cattle</SPAN><BR>
It's pretty tough to rationalize what the cattle did to
deserve the celestial smackdown. But admittedly that's a revisionist,
post-<CITE>Babe</CITE> take on the situation. The Big Guy was never big
on animal rights, what with the scapegoats and fatted calves and such.
He am that he am, pardner, cows or no cows. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Vermin</SPAN><BR>
Might have been lice, might have been gnats, but I doubt that the
Egyptians were worried about genus and species. "Gosh, I wonder what exact
breed of insect is clogging my nostrils?"  is not a question you hear very
often. That's what I like about Passover seders: they're about the only
time you're encouraged to discuss insect infestations at the dinner table. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Boils</SPAN><BR>
Good one! Pus-filled sores are a too-often overlooked tool in shaping
social policy. If state governments were constitutionally allowed to
visit horrible skin afflictions on, say, schools which performed below
testing standards, I bet we'd soon have graduating classes which shamed
even those darned Europeans with their hoity-toity math skills and their
multi-language fluency and their grasp of geography. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Beasts</SPAN><BR>
Apparently this is kind of a tricky translation. The King James
Bible has "flies," one translated Torah I found has "insects," but "A
Rug Rats Passover" has it as wild beasts, so wild beasts it is.
I just saw <EM>Tarzan,</EM> so I can't help but imagine a scene Moses pounding
his chest and emitting a jungle yodel, followed a stampede of elephants
and baboons and panthers and, I dunno, toucans and stuff coming down
on Pharaoh and his buddies. It's not easy living in my head. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Darkness</SPAN><BR>
You know, after boils, locusts, dead farm animals, hail and other assorted
miseries, you'd think not having to look at your ravaged environs would
actually be relatively relaxing.  On the other hand, three days of not
being able to do anything but sit around and converse about how much it
sucks to be hated by God must have hastened the freeing process somewhat. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Death of the Firstborn</SPAN><BR>
Hey. Way uncool. But then, it's the Old Testament: Much of the OT is
taken up with the Creator coming down on group C for what group A did
to group B. Think of all the llamas that died in the Flood! Is there
any indication that the llamas had become insolent and cruel? Was God
dissatisfied with their performance as llamas? No! But all of them except
two took the big swim along with the human beings who were the problem
on the first place. It's all part of God's pre-Christ oeuvre. But that
doesn't mean I have to like it. <B>D-<B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Swings</SPAN><BR>
I've noticed an increasing number of newish playgounds with no swings,
or only baby swings.  This is a pity, because whether you want to be
Superman or a fairy princess, when you're a kid all best-case scenarios
involve the power of flight, and swings are about as close as you're
going to get. Some of these parks still have the sumo-pants
baby swings, but in my graham cracker days I was considered something

not worth the effort. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tic-Tac-Toe Games</SPAN><BR>
Oh, please. This seems to be what the more litigationally timid
playgrounds are providing in place of swings and other potential
bone-cracking amusements: big plastic dowels with Xs and Os on them

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Monkey Bars</SPAN><BR>
It's hard to form an objective opinion on these, because I hate them. They
mock me. Monkey bars are filed in my mind under "things I never quite

a monkey-bar chasm ended up with me in the sand, cursing second grade
and vowing to use an as-yet-undiscovered worldwide publishing medium to
wreak my revenge on those who laughed at me. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tractory Sand-Moving Devices</SPAN><BR>
The whole process of moving sand around in a playground is as futile as it
is popular. It's not like some future documentary narrator is going to say
"Center Street Park: a harsh wilderness brought to heel  by generations
of grade-schoolers who labored tirelessly, piling the sand into little
hills." But I like it anyway. It's meditative. The sand was there,
now it's here, and you made it happen. <B>B-</B></P>

Centrifugal force! Whee! Nothing like nearly being thrown from a moving

I remember this game from the early 80s, when the video game Centipede
was supernova hot, so hot indeed that Tomy made a stupid little plastic
game with a transparent Centipede theme. Unlike Centipede, in which
you dismember an insect with callous efficiency, Catch a Caterpillar
challenges you to <EM>assemble</EM> an insect from individual insect
pieces, also known as "BBs," making the game more like a combination
of Cootie and Gothic horror than a video game.  According to the
instructions, you "release shooter to fire, aiming into center opening,"
which sounds great except you can't actually aim. You just shoot one BB
after another, hoping the mysterious power of magnetism will cause them

This belongs to one of my favorite Tomy Game subgenera, the "annoying

tempted to describe as a nasal rattling, in spite of the fact that
the game does not actually have a nose. Except, of course, for the
painted nose of the dragon you have to avoid along with his friends
the evil plush spider, the evil vaguely-amused-looking skull, and
the evil happy pile of excrement. You have to get your intrepid
adventurer, also known as a "BB," past these dangers and to the safety
of what is either a castle or a small mob of gnomes before the rattling
stops, or else your adventurer is held in place by the still-mysterious
if increasingly commonplace power of magnetism. <B>D</B></P></TD>

in real life, each direct hit causes the enemy helicopter to move forward
a small distance, except for the 8th, which makes it explode. I hear

"A real test of skill for more advanced Pocket game players," this

an advanced Pocket Game player. This game, which is both dull and awkward --
although perhaps that's just because I'm not advanced enough -- emulates
the dull and awkward game of golf. Each of nine "holes" is created
by rotating the little golfy landscape they have set up for you, which
is kind of clever at the same time that it doesn't actually improve

you're a "Robotics Expert." I'm sure you, like all thinking people, would

a bright spot in the dull Hundred-Acre Wood roll call, until
you realize that "eeyore" is just Brit-speak for the noise a
donkey makes. Bonus points for effort, but <B>C</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tigger</SPAN><BR>
I know a lot of people who really really really like Tigger,
and they tend to disturb and unnerve me. Actually, in the books
Tigger's this kind of friendly odd exuberant carnivore with
an inexplicable taste for Extract of Malt. But for the cartoon
they gave him a lisp, a sproingy tail
and a song-and-dance number, and I just
can't stand him anymore. Another factor to support the old
"Disney is the avatar of the Beast" theory. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Small</SPAN><BR>
"Small?" I can hear many people saying. "What's a Small? I don't
remember any T-shirts, thermoses, videos, jammies, plastic infant
juice cups, porcelain bookends, stamps from the Virgin Islands,
throw pillows, nightlights, or latex marital aids with this
'Small' on them." That's because Small is a beetle from the books,
and as such, doesn't look good on collectible merchandise. But
beetles are an integral part of the Milne oeuvre, as evidenced
by such poems as "Alexander Beetle," and Small is a
fine and shining example thereof. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Christopher Robin</SPAN><BR>
Chris comes off as a bit of a milquetoast in the books, unfortunately.
You can't blame <EM>him</EM>, really. It's the haircut and the
outfit. Take Attila the Hun, give him a pageboy and slap him in some
shorts and the rest of the Mongolian hordes are going to be pointing
and laughing. But lest you take C.R. lightly, consider these two factors:
First, Chapter One clearly states that he always carries a gun.
Secondly, he took the only flood-proof
ground in the 40.49-Hectare-Wood, leaving the rest of the residents
to flail around like ants under a garden hose. Not a guy to mess with.
<B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Owl</SPAN><BR>
I always kind of liked Owl. I mean, anyone who can get "HIPY PAPY 
BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY" out of "Happy Birthday" has got to be
a great drug connection, if nothing else. He's also the only one
of the gang besides Eeyore who seems to have mastered the art
of sarcasm. The whole Wise Old Owl thing, of course, extends
from Greek myth to Tootsie Roll ads, and while Owl doesn't exactly
transcend the genre, at least he's got a tradition backing him up.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mattresses</SPAN><BR>
Sunglass ads notwithstanding, these don't actually strike
me as a feasible mode of relaxation. Aside from the fact that
shifting your weight suddenly means a dunk, aside from the 
"invitation to melanoma" factor, aside from the chlorine fumes,
it's hard to feel truly mellow when your head bangs against
a concrete pool rim every few minutes. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Water Wings</SPAN><BR>
Although they look goofy on anyone over the age of five,
these inflatable armpit training wheels are at least more
humane than the other traditional method of learning to swim,
the "uncle throws you into the deep end" school of aquatic
instruction. They don't look like an incredibly reliable
device -- I wouldn't want them handed to me when the whale-watching
tour boat I'm on is capsized by a shy humpback -- but hey, whatever
it takes to give a kid a little confidence. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Water Polo Equipment</SPAN><BR>
Ball games are odd. People seem obsessed with trying
to combine ball games with every mode of transportation:
horseback riding, ice skating, and I once saw a game
where people run cars into a huge Earthball. At any
rate, I'm not entirely sure what being wet adds to the 
sport, aside from making a great Mountain Dew
commercial. My invention to make it more interesting, at
least for the spectators: Marco Water Polo, where everyone
has to keep their eyes closed. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Diving Sticks</SPAN><BR>
These I've only seen in catalogs. They're brightly colored sticks,
and apparently the idea is that you throw them in the water, they
sink, and then go you get them. Sounds pretty tedious, unless
you aspire to be a golder retriever. I've always
found pocket change to be both more of a challenge and more of
a motivator. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Floaty Horsey Rings</SPAN><BR>
I can't remember the last time I saw a real floaty
horsey ring, but I'm willing to endorse them on principle. I have
a soft spot for things that I see more often in cartoons than
in real life: floaty horsey things, boxer shorts with hearts
on them, anvils, round black bombs with sparky fuses, polite
gophers, that sort of thing. So if I did actually run into
a floaty horsey ring, I'm sure I'd enjoy it. <B>A</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Popeye</SPAN><BR>
Popeye's moral lesson was simple: any problem can be solved with a
combination of violence and nutrition. Except, apparently, the problems of severe
facial disfiguration, hypertrophy of the forearms, and
nicotine addiction. I think the low point of Popeye's career
was when he was signed up to hawk Quaker oats, which was
humiliating for both him and the Quakers. At any rate, while
I can't condone his approach to problem-solving, I do admire
his taste in tattoos. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bluto</SPAN><BR>
Bluto was also known as Brutus, for reasons I can't fathom. It
kind of ruined my appreciation for "Julius Caesar," though, because
I always expect Caesar to pull out a can of spinach and start
doing some hornpipe-backed ass-kicking. And then I get into this
whole mental fugue with Olive Oyl wailing "Beware the Ides of
Maaaaarch" and Wimpy asking the Romans to lend him their ears
until Tuesday and then the whole Betty Boop thing sets in and
it's just a bad scene all around. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Olive Oyl</SPAN><BR>
Did you see the movie version of Popeye? Wasn't the resemblance between
Olive Oyl and Shelly Duvall amazing? Duvall is obviously a woman who's
willing to play on her strengths no matter <EM>what</EM> they are.
This just goes to show the importance of style: presumably
Olive Oyl could have been in "Roxanne" if she didn't shop at the same 
boutique as "Nancy." But as-is, Olive Oyl is not much of a role model.
Even those who consider push-up bras an empowering statement on
the power of the feminine would have tough time fitting a screeching
anorexic career victim -- Rapunzel sans decent hairdo -- into a
coherent post-feminist ethic. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wimpy</SPAN><BR>
My clearest memory of Wimpy is from the Sinbad-based short where Wimpy
spends the entire cartoon following some sort of a bird with a meat grinder,
while Popeye and Bluto/Brutus/Sinbad do the usual pugilistic love
triangle thing with Olive. It's kind of a gruesome image, when you think about it;
if Wimpy had actually caught up with the bird he would have ground it
alive, the bird screaming as its blood and innards soiled Wimpy's
natty outfit. It's not the sort of thing you would figure Wimpy would
be into, but in the end I wouldn't be at all surprised if Wimpy were
to snap like a store-brand pretzel and mow down the entire Popeye
cast, shouting "It's Tuesday, people! <EM>Payback time!</EM>" <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Swee'pea</SPAN><BR>
Nothing like an androgynous bastard with no visible feet to liven up
a cartoon. For God's sake, why don't cartoon characters just have kids
of their own? Popeye, Mickey, Donald, it's nephews and foundlings.
Makes you wonder if they don't have something to hide. Swee'pea is
obviously not Olive's kid -- whatever "child-bearing hips" are, hers aren't --
but it's not inconceivable that the kid could be the result of Popeye's
brief tryst with an extremely wiry prostitute in some exotic port of call.
I'd point out that there's kind of a bad-gene-pool resemblance between
the two, but frankly everyone is Popeye's little world looks like
they got up on the wrong side of the genetic code. <B>D+</B></P>

This card features a completely nude Gena Lee Nolin with a bad case of
mermaid hair. Now me, I'd consider a primordial rainforest to be
a great place to put clothes on, what with the insects and the jaguar
scratches and the fish that swim up your urethra. And I'm guessing, just
guessing here, that Nolin puts some sort of savage ensemble together for
the actual show, but here on the postcard she resembles the jaybird in

This is intended, I think, to portray the mouth of some sort of

and I don't think it was a complete accident. While normally a staunch

The top half of this card is taken up with a college-dorm painting
of three ladies -- each with a different hair color, following
the Apartment 3-G Rule -- enjoying a pizza and not actually facing 
each other. The whole thing is very heartwarming until you realize
they're probably just watching TV. Anyhow, there's a recipe below

This card follows in the fine Los Angeles advertising tradition of not
telling you what the hell they're advertising. Presumably, looking at this
card, I will be compelled to invest in jeans, or boots, or possibly concrete.
Only the tiny words "A Kenneth Cole Production" provide a clue as to
what product I'm intended to covet. Well, they <em>are</em> nice boots. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

Apparently this has something to do with a book called "The Sisterhood of
the Traveling Pants" which I have to admit is a catchy title. Pretty much
anything with "pants" in it gets my attention, it's sad. Anyhow, the
first rule of the SotTP is "You must never wash the pants." I thought
this was some sort of female bonding sentimental thing, but according
to the Web site the eighth rule involves spanking so now I'm not so sure. <B>C</B></P></TD>

<P><BIG><B>Fries</B></BIG><BR>
The variety and scope of french fries produced in this country is 
truly horrifying and blasphemous. Shoestring, wedge cut, crinkly, curly,
spicy, cheesy, the list goes on and on. There's a theory going around which
I just made up that says that there is a one-to-one relationship between
subatomic particles discovered and french fry variations created. Think
about it. A while back they finally pinned down the "top" variety of quark,
(don't ask) and that same week I found a place that serves "Irish Cut Fries."
Weird. Eerie. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Toy Heads</B></BIG><BR>
Not that these are actually made out of potatoes any more. And
they don't put a lot of work into making him look like a potato.
Really, he should be called "Mr. Potato-esque Plastic Blob Head." Which I
think is my new band name. But I digress. Better than the usual toy are
plastic face and body parts you can buy and
stick with wild abandon into actual potatoes, giving you
a juicy, starchy quality you don't usually find in playroom fun. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Guns</B></BIG><BR>
Having seen these
for sale in comic books since I was a kid, I finally bought one. However,
those self-same comic book ads also tried to sell me X-Ray Specs and Onion
Gum so my expectations weren't exactly high. As it turns out the damn things
WORK. Not only did it send little tuber missiles soaring through the air,
it did so with an audible pop, filling me with glee and antisocial
intentions. Even better, the packaging tells you how to CLEAN and OIL your
potato gun. I'm going to train myself to disassemble, clean, oil and
reassemble my potato gun in thirty seconds even in total darkness. <B>A</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Chips</B></BIG><BR>
I'm going to have to take an unpopular stance here. Potato chips are
kind of gross. Oh, sure, I'll ransack any bags or storage cylinders of chips
you have lying around, but I'll feel remorse afterwards, because potato
chips are pretty much as vile as you can get with a snack food that has no
"creamy filling." Even worse are flavored potato chips; sour cream and
onion chips, barbecue chips, salt and vinegar chips that burn an acidic
hole through your cheeks. I need to go wash now. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Baked</B></BIG><BR>
Baked potatoes give me eighties flashbacks. Somewhere in there
someone decided that baked potatoes were health food, so they came up with
"potato bars" which are like salad bars with more of an emphasis on chives.
Then various health-conscious young professionals made themselves nice
"healthy" lunches with about a one-to-one relationship of potato and sour
cream, making the humble potato the denial diet food of the decade. It was a
sad time. <B>C</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Animals</B></BIG><BR>
Yes! Potato animals! Oh, come ON! You remember! Pathetic rainy day
activities! Four pencils, a toothpick, a pink eraser and a potato and you
had an odd malformed creature that could easily haunt your nightmares. This
was always sort of a last resort activity, once you had done the paper
airplanes and the connect-the-dots and you couldn't stand to look at another
damn Colorform. And why? Because it didn't DO anything! You took about
thirty seconds to make and just stood there. Sometimes it's tough being a
kid. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><B>Electric Screwdrivers</B><BR>
Thank Black and/or Decker for electric screwdrivers! I could probably
get through the rest of my life without sanding, sawing or taking any
interest in dovetailing, but I know that I have many pieces of cheap
Swedish furniture to assemble before I sleep.  Using a screwdriver
doesn't even work off frustration like hammering, so I'm glad to sit back
and let sweet, sweet electricity do the work.  <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Bandsaws</B><BR>
I think I used a bandsaw once, and I seem to remember that I was less
interested in actually building something and more in playing "No, Mr.
Bond, I expect you to die" in my head.  Until I realized that I could cut
squiggles, and switched to making a jigsaw puzzle you could assemble into
a picture of wood.  After about two minutes I was ready to move on.  <B>D+</B></P>

<P><B>Electric Sander</B><BR>
Sanding, I think, is what turned me off to the whole idea of woodshop.
the very idea that you need multiple grains of sandpaper to get the final
effect made me realize that I would be wasting valuable time I could be
spending not sanding things.  Even the prospect of an electric sander
doesn't improve things, because it still requires attention to detail.
I just can't look at a piece of wood for that long. <B>D</B></P>

<P><B>Electric Drill</B><BR>
You know how they say "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks
like a nail, especially nails"? Get an electric drill in your hands and
you suddenly become aware of exactly how much drywall surrounds you.
And all of it yours for the puncturing.  I don't think I should be
allowed to have one of these.  It puts notions in my head.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><B>Lathe</B><BR>
I like lathes because radial symmetry is a hobby of mine.  The ability to
affect all sides of an object without having to actually move around make
me feel like I have super speed and can tie criminals up in milliseconds
and make whirlwinds and table legs.  If they make a machine that can
catch bullets for me I'm set. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Telepathy</SPAN><BR>
Being privy to every little thought of those around you seems like a great idea until you read a couple dozen online diaries. This is one power you'd want to be able to turn off, lest you be driven insane the first time you happened across a poetry reading. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Telekinesis</SPAN><BR>
I find the idea of lifting things without having to lift my ass off the futon very appealing, but I imagine that even such fantastic power would be no match for my incredible inertia. After all, chances are I'd have to furrow my brow and touch my temple to make it work, and that's a lot of effort when the empty Chinese food carton seems happy where it is. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Precognition</SPAN><BR>
I'd like to be able to see what happens to other people with clarity, if for no other reason than to piss off James Randi, but I'm not sure I'd want to be able to see what will happen to me, because of that thing where you see you're going to be killed by a bear so you decide never to go to the woods or a zoo or any other place where bears congregate and then you die in a K-B Toys when an oversized plaster promotional Teddy bear falls on you and you feel really dumb. Because you could have gone to the zoo all that time. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Postcognition</SPAN><BR>
This is kind of a goofy power -- the ability to see what happened to an object or in a place in the past -- but I like it. You could find missing children, figure out where you put your keys, and tell people interesting things about their used furniture. The most important use, though, is figuring out who keeps taking the food from the fridge in the break room. At last, at long last, your Lean Pockets would be safe. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Empathy</SPAN><BR>
Troi proved that empathy is perhaps the lamest psychic power of all, unless your great ambition in life is to listen to people complain about their failed relationships. In normal life, the ability to tell that the latte wrangler across the counter resents your indecision on flavored syrup is no help to either of you. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pyrokinesis</SPAN><BR>
You can't go wrong with fire. The only problem with the power to make things ignite and/or explode is that there aren't enough chances to use it once the cigarette trick and the fireplace trick get old. You pretty much have to turn into an insane force of elemental destruction or you'll get really antsy. <B>C</B></P>

reveals a thriving historical slash community. Weird. Eerie.
Anyhow, I like pelicans. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Indiana</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The Indiana quarter features a race car about to zoom off the
face of the quarter to do a few quick laps around the tip jar.
There are some stars and an outline and a slogan, as well, the
usual iconography, but the race car rather attracts the eye.
It's also a reasonable representation of what people think of
first when you say "Indiana," if you rule out Indiana Avenue
from Monopoly and that song from "The Music Man." The motto
provided is "Crossroads of America." One thing I learned on
my cross-country drive is that there are apparently a dozen
or so places claiming to be America's Crossroads, and probably  
a couple more designated as America's Place Where You Pull a U-ie 
When You Realize You Missed America's Turnoff. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

X is some combination of flower, bird, tree, flag, motto, or
waffle topping--I have to admire Mississippi for going bulbs out
with their currency-dominating representation of Magnoliar, the
Flower That Ate Biloxi. I would have preferred some screaming
people in the space allocated to "The Magnolia State" written
in some sort of curly tea-party font, but I'm willing to compromise. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingbody">The centerpiece of this twenty-five cent piece is a young Abraham Lincoln stepping through the irregular outline of a time portal into an unspecified point outside Chicago. Judging from his posture, his goal is to break into the Chicago comedy scene with a Tim Allen-esque caveman impression. God speed, young comedy neanderthal Abraham Lincoln!

What an inspiring message to the young Alabaman who may be considering literacy! The quarters have Helen Keller's name in tiny miniature braille, presumably so that blind pixies and elves can enjoy them as well.

The schooner, the US Mint Web site informs us, "resembles 'Victory Chimes,'" which to us non-Maine layfolk just means that it's a picture of a schooner. "'Victory Chimes,'" it continues, "has become synonymous with Maine windjamming." Not windjamming in general, mind you. Maine windjamming. Presumably Rhode Island windjamming has its own set of synonyms, leading to wacky, sitcom-worthy mixups at interstate windjamming meets, or as windjamming aficionados call them, "cluster-fucks." <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingbody">Missouri further explores the time-travel theme pioneered by Illinois, picturing Lewis and Clark returning to the St. Louis Arch, which was built decades later to commemorate their return. This makes me wonder: what if the arch fell on them, killing them before they could complete their journey? Then, presumably, the arch wouldn't be built, which means that it couldn't fall on them, so they'd successfully complete the journey, which means that it <em>would</em> be built, which means it would kill them.

If you put photographs of those things in front of me and asked what they had in common, I would boggle at them until my angry brain cut me off from reality and informed me I was now Duke of Teacup Land. I would be a wise but firm ruler to the small, breakable people of Teacup Land, living a long life and siring many strong sons who would fight over the throne even as they stood over my deathbed. Eventually I would drift off into smug death, never knowing that the answer was "Arkansas." <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Galoshes</SPAN><BR>
Footwear that keeps water out also keeps it in. That's a simple
fact. So if you're really careful, galoshes can keep your socks
dry. If you're <EM>not</EM> really careful, though, they quickly become
Lipton Cup O' Foot Soup. I am rarely really careful, so I don't
bother with galoshes. My socks may be wet, but at least there's
flow-through. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ponchos</SPAN><BR>
It's the simple things that make life so grand. Things like
sticking your head through a hole. Ponchos are nice that way.
They're also nice because they're generally big enough to
protect any backpacks, purses, pages, PDAs, leathermen, or South
American clinging primates you might be carrying on you. And if
you're as tall as I am they can be used as a Slip 'N' Slide
in the summer months. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Umbrellas</SPAN><BR>
These are so nice and playful and fun and enjoyable that I'm
willing to overlook the fact that they don't work worth driveway
gravel. Unless you come from the Magical Land of Entirely
Vertical Precipitation, your entire lower body is going to get
soaked by any stroll longer than from the car to the coffee shop.
But more effective rain protection rarely comes in the shape of
a happy frog head, so it's a trade-off. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rain Hats</SPAN><BR>
I don't see enough of these. Why aren't people wearing rain hats?
About the only people I ever see in rain hats are kids in Kodak commercials
and Christopher Robin. Maybe I need to live someplace rainier. Or
someplace where people are more casual about putting yellow rubber
things on their heads. Either way. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rain Suit</SPAN><BR>
The really good rain suits are the transparent ones, because
you can put them on and pretend to be ribbed for her pleasure.
Alternatively, if you're wearing a nice suit you can pretend
that you sent your whole body to the dry cleaners and just
got it back. Both of which are more fun than admitting you're
just a wet dork in a plastic sheath. <B>D+</B></P>

<div class="ratings">
<p class="ratingheader">August</p>
<p class="ratingbody">When I was a kid, August bugged me. It's the only month, in the US at least,
with no major holidays. Of course, it was summer and I was out of school
anyway, but dammit, I wanted a holiday! Preferably one involving a nice
meal. Cold cuts, maybe. The Feast of Cold Cuts. There you go. Anyhow,
August is also hot and sticky and named after some moldy old Roman, so
really it doesn't get any better the closer you examine it. <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">September</p>
<p class="ratingbody">September, while nicely cool and usually pretty, doesn't really have much going on in the holiday area either,
modulo Rosh Hashanah if you're Jewish. It does have the whole back-to-school
aspect, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand you get various 
cartoon-imprinted folders and pencil sharpeners and such, but on the other hand,
you know, back to school. But now that I'm an adult and I can and do buy a 
Powerpuff Girls lunchbox any time I want, that doesn't bother me anymore. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">October</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Halloween is good. Columbus Day is one of those "holidays" that affect
only postal workers and bank tellers. October is also when the weather starts
settling down into some serious stinkiness or, on the California coast,
intermittent hazy skies. Growing up in California, weather was 
something that happened to other people, like meteor strikes or 
cholera. <span class="ratinggrade">B+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">November</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This is where it all starts; the whole yuletide currency-fest. We should
just consolidate November and December, make up a name in Latin that
refers to credit cards and/or animatronic bears in red hats, and have done
with it. At least November has a feast holiday. But you have to wade through
an oozing tide of holly-bedecked used car salesmen on TV to get to it. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">December</p>
<p class="ratingbody">If the Star Wars series was a year, it would end with The Empire Strikes
Back. It's kind of pretty, but very dark, and it has many exciting parts
but overall it's pretty much a bummer. Jeez, I really hope the rest of the
Matrix trilogy is good so that I can stop making these constant references
to Star Wars. You know how old people are always talking about the
depression and/or World War II? My generation's going to be like that
with Star Wars. We're going to make all these addled references to Bespin 
and Yavin and the youth will hate us for it. But I digress. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">January</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I think having January as the first month of the New Year encourages
cynicism in many people. They get drunk off their ass in the spirit of renewal and
the hope for a bright future, and the next day it's still cold, wet, and
dismal. And that's pretty much what they come to expect from life. Me, I like the rain. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">February</p>

<p class="ratingbody">Pronouncing the first "r" in "February" is like making a homemade
Seaquest DSV uniform: It's a pain in the butt and very few people
appreciate the effort. Having said that, I like February because
of the 28 day thing and because of the leap year thing. Plus it has
Groundhog Day, which is the most cheerfully pointless holiday
that people actually celebrate. (People do not actually celebrate
Frozen Food Week, no matter what your grocery chain flyers tell you.) <span class="ratinggrade">B+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">March</p>

<p class="ratingbody">In like a lion, out like some variety of young domesticated herbivorous
mammal. March has an equinox, which isn't something I paid much attention
to until I started to have so many pagan friends. Equinoxes and solstices
are such sensible things to celebrate that I'm tempted to take up pagantry
in my spare time, but for now I'll just stick with my practice of
referring to Saint Patrick's Day as the Tavernal Equinox. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">April</p>

<p class="ratingbody">You may have noticed, if you've been hanging around for a while and have
put at least three points into perception skills, that this space does not
engage in April Fool's shenanigans. Frankly, I've never felt comfortable
being a goof on Officially Designated Goof Occasions.  It's pretty much
the same reason I didn't put a silly message on my answering machine back
when that was all the rage. Remember that? You couldn't call a freakin'
notary public without having to listen to a five minute rendition of
highlights from <cite>Les Miserables</cite> with clever lyrics on the
subject of leaving a message and not being home. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">May</p>

<p class="ratingbody">May is a good month. It probably doesn't get enough credit. Quite the
opposite, really. "Mayday" is now something you shout in movies just
before the aliens get your plane, and a "mayfly" is just unpleasant. But
May is pleasant, by and large. In the northern hemisphere. You
Australians are, as in so many things, on your own. I suppose you can
make sense of this series if you switch the months around. Except for
the holidays. And put some holidays of your own in. Go ahead and put some
derogatory comments about New Zealanders in there too, you've earned it. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">June</p>

<p class="ratingbody">June is my birth month, and I am nothing if not self-centered, so I'm
willing to overlook many of my usual complaints about the summer months
(too hot, too bright, too many commercials featuring the song "Summertime
Blues") and bask in my own glory for a second. Bask bask. Okay, that's
done. June is too hot, too bright, and they could at least use the Joan
Jett cover once in a while. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">July</p>

<p class="ratingbody">I'm not much into the confluence of patriotism and traffic jams, but
I do enjoy fireworks. Nobody seems to do fireworks in shapes like they
do on cartoons, though. You know, where they get a whole American eagle
complete with arrows and basil leaves up there? I once saw a fireworks
display where they managed to work up some smiley faces which where kind
of lopsided and often upside down. While I appreciated the effort, the
pyros really need to get the eagle happening to tell the cartoon guys
to stop raising our hopes. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><I>Struthio Camelus</I></SPAN><BR>
This was completely unfair. In order to even get this, you had
to know first that in "Joust" one of the players rides
an ostrich, and secondly that <I>Struthio Camelus</I> is
the scientific name for a common species of ostrich. I'm sure
there are about three ornithologist video game enthusiasts
out there who thought this was hilarious, but really now... <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shirley Jones</SPAN><BR>
On the other hand, I make no apologies for references to
TV stars from the Seventies. From Leather Tuscadero to
Marshall, Will and Holly, if they've got feathered hair and a penchant
for the word "groovy," they're going to end up here  sooner or
later. So if you don't recognize the sacred name of the Partridge Matriarch,
you may want to take a remedial class or something. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ziggurat</SPAN><BR>
Okay, so technically the tower in Q*bert isn't a ziggurat,
partly because the little ridges don't go all around, and
partly because Q*bert isn't technically Mesopotamian. But
if the Mesopotamians spent less time creating the oldest legal code
preserved in its entirety and more time hopping around avoiding purple snakes,
I'm willing to bet the two would look eerily similar. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jet Engine Testing Cannons</SPAN><BR>
These, for those of you not "in the hip" about such things, are
devices which shoot dead chickens at powered-up jet engines under
controlled circumstances in order to determine whether said engines
can survive the impact, the chicken's survival being a moot point.
There's a story about inadvertently using frozen chickens which is
too unlikely to reprint here, but it serves to illustrate that
there's actually already a distinguished body of dead chicken cannon
literature out there, of which this space is only a small part.
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">'74 Dodge Dart</SPAN><BR>
This may shock some of the faithful, but I actually
have no idea how prone to oil leaks Dodge Darts are. I had
a friend who had a lot of trouble with hers, though,
and "Dodge Dart" is a funny name (and good advice, when you think about it)
so rather than spend time going through maintenance history for hundreds
of American cars, I just went with it. I'd say I used the time saved
to create new and better comedy for your daily consumption, but
actually I made a grilled cheese sandwich and took
a "test your kissability" quiz in <I>YM</I>. <B>C</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Eject</SPAN><BR>
It's pretty rare to find eject on a remote control, and that bothers
me. I can understand the reasoning: you're going to have to extract
your ass from the dents in the couch cushions to grab the tape anyway,
so what to you need an eject button for. And that would make perfect sense
except that the front panels of VCRs are inevitably tastefully illegible,
requiring you to bend down and get so close to the buttons you might as
well press them with your nose. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pause</SPAN><BR>
Pausing your favorite shows and movies is half the reason for
buying a VCR. It really shows those tapes who's in charge here. Whatever
Nicolas Cage is going off about, he's just going to have to zip
it and wait while you grab another Fresca. It's also handy for investigating
rumors of on-screen suicides and playing "Is That a Body Double?" <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rewind</SPAN><BR>
Current rewinding technology is perfectly adequate, but I'm waiting
for the VCR that provides Distortion-Free 1:1 Speed Visual Rewind,
also known as "playing the movie backwards." Who doesn't like seeing
movies run backward? Milk squirts back into people's mouths! Cars
pull themselves off lamp posts and miraculously repair themselves while
smoke pours back into the tailpipe! Disney heroes renounce their loved
ones, lose their faith in themselves, and return to their oppressive
origins! It's fun! <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fast Forward</SPAN><BR>
Fast forward is handy for skipping past commericals in
recorded TV shows, but more often than not I'll fail to recognize the
last commerial in the pack and hit play too late, missing the first few
words in the description of the llama-fat-and-summer-melon bisque on
"Iron Chef." I propose the addition of a "fast-forward, but back
up a skosh afterwards" button. Also, I propose the elimination of
fast-forward modes that are too staticky to tell whether you're still
on last week's ER or you've moved to an old recording of "Seaquest DSV."
<B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Play</SPAN><BR>
Classic in its simplicity, "Play" takes its place along such timeless
buttons as "On," "OK," and "Toast." Some may claim that "Play" is too
na&iuml;ve for a complex post-podern, pre-contemporary, inter-millennial
world where buttons like "Standby" and "Zero Back" hold sway. However,
without beacons of selection like "Play," we sink
into a quagmire where "control" is relative and we are most
"remote" from our own souls. <B>A</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Madonna</B></BIG><BR>
Good lord in heaven, when is this woman going to go away? In my
world she would have slid into obscurity about the same time Mr. T did,
leaving us with fond retro memories, but no, she's become VH-1's favorite
self-fulfilling prophesy. Let me just say this: La Isla Bonita is one of the
most traumatically bad songs ever to pass through human vocal chords. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Prince</B></BIG><BR>
The artist formerly known as talented. For a while there it looked
like Prince was going to end up being the most essentially gifted of the
eighties Michael Jackson/Madonna/Prince triumvirate, but apparently the same
brain disease that led Michael to bleach himself and marry a Presley and
Madonna to charge fifty bucks for self-indulgent soft-core porn got to
Prince, because he's gotten simultaneously weirder and less interesting
since he changed his name to the path neutrinos take in a high-speed nuclear
collision. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Morrissey</B></BIG><BR>
The frown prince of the Depressed British Persons Genre, Morrissey
for reasons I can't fathom turned a lot of teenage girls on in the
eighties, which is a classic case of choosing poorly because the man himself
admits he has no sex drive. Still, I'm sure many groupies were breathlessly
led backstage to spend a night listening to him kvetch melodically. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Cher</B></BIG><BR>
Oh, please. Made a lot of money in the eighties in spite of the fact
that she peaked with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)." "Moonstruck" may have 
something to do with it; the film seemed really good at the time but it hasn't 
aged well. Nowadays it feels like "Italiansomething." And then she made 
commercials for Equal artificial sweetener. Boo. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Hammer</B></BIG><BR>
Started out as M.C. Hammer, he changed his name to Hammer just about
the time no one cared. It just goes to show you how fickle fame can be. For
a while there he was as hot as hot can be, and then a couple years later
he's doing Grad Night at Disney with L.L. Cool J and Run-DMC.  Lesson to be
learned? Rappers need a strong investment portfolio. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Sting</B></BIG><BR>
I liked the Police. Synchronicity was a great album, especially that
bit about my mother on the phone. Sting on his own, however, is an
overexposed morass of self-importance and violins. And what the HELL is it
with that line about a big enough umbrella that he puts in three-tenths of
his songs? If I hear one more time about how it's always him that ends up
getting wet I'm going to mangle something important to me. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gerbils</SPAN><BR>
First off, this space will not be addressing "gerbilling".  You
want dirt, go check out Usenet.   Now, then. Being a Californian, gerbils
are illegal in my area and so have the same exciting air of insurrection as
other un-Californian activities such as picking California poppies, keeping ferrets,
or refusing to see a chiropractor.  I've
never actually seen a live  gerbil, but they look passably cute in the pictures.
So loathsome rumors aside, <B>B</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hamsters</SPAN><BR>
Hamsters are to elementary schools as Microsoft is to office
buildings.  These little monsters are nasty, dull, brutish, and short, but
every k-12 in North America seems to have one or more, 
apparently to insure rodent compatibility with every other
k-12.  
The only mitigating factor is that they can do the Huge Cheek Pouches of
Food trick, which hardly makes up for things.  <B>D</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Guinea Pigs</SPAN><BR>
I'm convinced these guys aren't so much domesticated as
trapped.  Pet stores often put rabbits and guinea pigs together for
petting, and while rabbits are generally pretty blas&eacute; about the whole deal,
the guineas go into paroxysms of squealing and skittering if you so much as
reach towards them.  The guineas don't enjoy it, the kids don't enjoy it,
and it's dumb.  <B>C-</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mice</SPAN><BR>
While mice aren't, in my experience, terribly affectionate, they are
pretty fun to watch when you get enough of them together that they aren't  all
asleep at once.  The problem, though, is that co-ed mouse communes start
reproducing at an a rate that makes "breeding like rabbits" seem like a pretty dumb
simile.  This is nice for pet stores, where most of them go to feed
endothermic (read: "scaly") life forms, but not so great for the home
game.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rabbits</SPAN><BR>
Yes, I know rabbits aren't rodents.  I'm not sure what twisted
biological classification excludes them from <cite>Rodentia</CITE>, but my guess is that in
order to make themselves feel constantly superior to us former humanities majors,
biologists have decided to exclude one species from every obvious class for
made-up reasons.  Thus, rabbits aren't rodents, pandas
aren't bears, daddy long-legs aren't spiders, and news anchors are not,
technically speaking, furniture.  Leviticus had it right, man.  Does it
fly?  Does it creep?  It's a flying , creeping thing, don't eat it, end
of story.  Anyhow, rabbits.  They're mellow, you can housebreak them, <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rats</SPAN><BR>
Aw-RIGHT!  Rats are the primo rodents to have around.  Points to
support this thesis: 1)  They don't run away, even if you leave their cage
open, because they know where The Big Hand puts the food.  
2) When you take them out they want to explore, instead
of finding a hole and going to sleep.  3)  They can be trained to come when
you call.  When was the last time you saw a guinea pig do that trick?  4)
Their scaly tails drive away insecure milksops who can't stand to have a manifestation
of their own id explore their hair. Right on! Rats hit a grand slam! <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Constitution</SPAN><BR>
You probably know what I'm going to say here, but
I'm going to say it anyway: thanks to this cartoon,
nobody born in the US between 1968 and 1975 can
recite the preamble to the Constitution without singing --
in their own private headspace if not right out loud. 
I was called upon to recite same in Junior High school,
and it was all I could do to keep from breaking out into a 
Janis-Joplin-inspired a cappella number. It was
very thoughtful of the Founding Fathers to set the
preamble to such a catchy folk-funk rhythm. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Interplanet Janet</SPAN><BR>
This just doesn't resonate with me. Not only is the song
mostly forgettable, but -- and this is the important
part -- the only catchy bit doesn't contain any useful
information. It just points out that Janet is a solar
system miss from a future world, which frankly describes
a good number of women I dated in college, and makes
a dumb baseball pun. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Five</SPAN><BR>
Is it just me, or does the big hide-and-seek bumpkin in
this number seem on the verge of some terrible Sling-Blade-esque
act of mentally disadvantaged homicide? I don't mean to be
gruesome here, but I can't help but imagine that the cops are going to find
this backwoods multiplication fan in overalls sobbing over the lifeless body of 
one of his cartoony urchin companions, saying "He wouldn't
multiply by <EM>five</EM>! I <EM>tol'</EM> him to multiply by five!"
Weird. Eerie. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Elbow Room</SPAN><BR>
What fun! A cheerful paean to Manifest Destiny and overpopulation!
Now we know that relentless expansion was just driven by the
need to <EM>dance</EM>! Take up the White Man's Boogie! Fifty-Four
Forty or Frug! And once we've choked the life out of every square
inch of <EM>this</EM> planet we'll go do the Expansionist Shuffle on
the moon! Most of the Schoolhouse oeuvre has aged remarkably well,
give or take that embarrassing scene in <CITE>Reality bites</CITE>,
but this one seems a tad shall we say na&iuml;ve. Catchy, though. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pronouns</SPAN><BR>
Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla! I wish <EM>my</EM> name were Rufus Xavier 
Sarsaparilla! Ironically enough, though, I'd insist that people <EM>not</EM>

Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla? How are Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla's wife

If anyone refused, I'd get Albert Andreas Armadillo's rhino to

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Three is a Magic Number</SPAN><BR>
While it's pleasant to see Schoolhouse Rock delving into
the occult, some of their evidence for the eldrich power of the
number three is pretty sketchy: people reproduce, human anatomy
can be divided into three parts if you ignore almost all major
organs, and tricycles have three wheels. I wasn't aware that 
tricycles figured so prominently in cabalistic lore.  <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Verb: That's What's Happening</SPAN><BR>
A very nice foray into horn-laced funk, although the vocals
sound kind of like <CITE>Jackson Browne Sings the Hits of
Sly and the Family Stone</CITE>. Extra points for the
chest-hair-exposing superhero, who apparently has the
incredible power to perform actions, and the affirmation at
the end that <EM>love</EM> is what's happening. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">A Victim of Gravity</SPAN><BR>
50's doo-wop seems out of place and tired in the Schoolhouse melange
of sixties and seventies pop music styles. Not to mention that the
first couple verses are dedicated to teaching kids the important
but difficult-to-grasp fact that things fall downward. An addition,
I object to the author's plea to keep Mary-Jean in the dark about
basic concepts of physics. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sufferin' Till Suffrage</SPAN><BR>
I'd like to point out that the red-headed 
diva belting this one out pioneered the "bell-bottoms, bare midriff,
and t-shirt with cute little graphic on it" look some twenty-five
years before it became popular. Um, again. She also continues
the superhero theme we see throughout the series, with her incredible
powers to twirl, transform into a powerful voting bloc, and adopt
historical women's fashions. I wonder if she and Verb are dating. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">I'm Just a Bill</SPAN><BR>
This is a catchy and remarkably complete treatment of a complicated
subject, featuring perhaps the most adorable piece of legislation
in history, although I understand the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act was
pretty cute. It helps that the bill in question concerns school-bus
safety. A tax hike or a law proclaiming National Mayonnaise Week
probably wouldn't have been as sympathetic. <B>A+</B></P>

A compass, when you think about it, is essentially a very primitive
Spirograph. A very primitive, very very boring Spirograph. And Spirographs
themselves aren't exactly a blowjob in Times Square either. I spent
many hours as a kid Spirographing before I realized with depressing
horror that Spirographs are essentially flat Slinkies that don't move.
But this isn't <EM>about</EM> me! This is about compasses, which aren't

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scooby-Doo</SPAN><BR>
Is it just me, or is there something eerie about Scooby?
He's not anthropomorphic, exactly, he just speaks English.
With a canine accent. It's as if trying to force his tortured
vocal cords to form sounds that no loving God ever
intended. Was he the result of some madman's blasphemous
experiments in creating life? Are the ghosts he's chasing really
the ghosts of his own inhuman mind? Should I get out more? <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scrappy-Doo</SPAN><BR>
Speaking of inhuman. I just want to get this twisted little bastard
out of the way so that I can go back to ignoring him. The more
astute readers among you may have noticed that I haven't yet gone
so far as to give anything an actual "F." That's not out
of any kind-heartedness on my part, it's just that every time I
got ready to give one out, I would ask myself, "is it really
that bad, compared to the verminous, soul-tainting badness of
Scrappy-Doo?" And now, at long last,
I have my chance. Prepare yourself, oh encephalitic hound.
<B>F!</B> Hahahahahaha! It feels <EM>good!</EM></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fred</SPAN><BR>
Man. Post-catharsis, I'm feeling pretty charitable toward the
entire rest of the animated gang. Heck, I could probably
give Quick-Draw McGraw a passing grade at this point. However,
objectivity is in order. Fred's dull. He's one bland blond.
He's a six-foot yawn in a cravat. His big thought every episode
is "let's split up," and he apparently takes fashion tips from
Mr. Howell. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Shaggy</SPAN><BR>
Hey, I'm way behind anyone voiced by Casey Kasem. Shaggy,
Robin, Cliffjumper from "The Transformers," 
anyone. I bet Casey and Don Pardo get together
and go to bars and enunciate clearly. But I digress.
Shaggy. Blah blah pot blah blah hippie blah blah munchies.
Every half-assed stand up comedian from here to the Catskills
has a bit on the Shaggy-reefer connection. But they don't
understand about Casey. Casey's the alpha and the omega of
Hanna-Barbera. That's all there is to say. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Velma</SPAN><BR>
This one wins the prestigious "Cartoon Character Whose Name
I Have to Look Up Most Often" award. Velma? Thelma? Selma, Alabama?
Anyhow, while Fred's getting fashion advice from Thurston, Velma
apparently gets her look from a bean bag that went to Catholic
school. She does seem to have more wits about her than the rest
of her gang, but saying she's the brains of the group is like
saying someone has the best social skills of anyone on "Ultima
Online." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Daphne</SPAN><BR>
I guess she's supposed to be the beauty of the group, but nobody
looks that great at 8 frames per second. Whereas Fred was merely
dull, Daphne was dull and pointless. Fred at least bossed people
around. Aside from chastising Shaggy and Scooby and getting caught
in the inevitable net trap, Daphne didn't really have much to do.
So of course she's the one they hang onto for the pathetic
"13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo" series. Pleh. <B>D</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wood Carving</SPAN><BR> 
Before I get started here, I should point out that I've never been in
the BSA. I was ostensibly in the Cub Scouts as a kid, but my activites
therein wouldn't qualify for any merit badges unless they had badges for
"Watching Cartoons" and "Playing Freeze Tag." So anyway, I think the main
thing I missed out on was the whittling. You're supposed to have a knife,
and you're supposed to be able to make little racing cars and impromptu
rabbit traps and rustic place settings with it. My only major knife
experience was with an X-Acto knife, and it required stitches, so I'm
probably better off despite my disappointment. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">American Labor</SPAN><BR>
This is just odd. I mean, there's nothing wrong with American
Labor per se, but you rarely end up using the words "AFL-CIO"
and "Campfire Jamboree" in the same sentence. 
My feeling is that in order to preserve political balance, there should be
a badge in "Union Busting" as well. ("For this badge, scouts must
put on a suit with a diamond tie-tack, light an expensive cigar, and
say 'Those poor sots don't know how good they got it. Lock the gates.'")
<B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bugling</SPAN><BR>
I had no idea there was a badge for bugling, but it makes perfect
sense, in spite of the fact that it sounds like a British term for an
uncomfortable sex act. One part of getting this badge is learning all the
bugle calls, including the one for swimming. I don't know why there's
a bugle call for swimming and not for other common camp activites
like furtive masturbation, but I guess that's why I don't get to write
the bugle book. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Space Exploration</SPAN><BR>
Talk about pipe dreams. At least a young scout can hold a reasonable
hope of carving a wooden duck, playing "Taps," or participating in
an auto workers' strike, but the chances of actually putting this
knowledge to work are pretty slim, unless you count pointing out
inconsistencies in "Apollo 13." On the other hand, if my choices are
between building a model rocket for this badge, or comparing double-knit
fabric to industrial-grade woven fabric for the "Textiles" badge,
I'm all over that plastic nose cone action. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Collections</SPAN><BR>
This is a real gimmee. The requirements basically come down to 
"Collect something. Talk about it." Most kids -- and most adults,
for that matter -- have collections of stuff just by virtue of 
not tossing it. I, for instance, have a collection of 286 motherboards,
and somewhere in my parents' garage I have a collection of 
He-Man action figures with missing limbs. Stick those mothers in a plexiglass case
and it's merit badge city. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pop-Top Clothing</SPAN><BR>
The art of taking soda pop-tops and making them into fashionable and attractive, in the sense of hideous and ugly, clothing, gets points for sheer weirdness. Pop-tops were the bane of bare feet for a decade, and yet some high-minded soul decided to take these painful, sharp-edged lemons and make lemonade. I have a vague yet persistent memory of two models in a magazine -- one male, one female -- posing in their matching vest-and-skirt pop-top outfits, happy, friendly, free of hang-ups in their shining suits of dorkmail. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Macrame</SPAN><BR>
Macrame is the art of tying ugly string and ugly decorations into ugly shapes in order to hold items which, if not ugly to begin with, certainly became so upon being swathed in this low-effort form of hippie knitting. This was part of the aesthetic of the early seventies in which folk art was judged by its resemblance to marijuana buds and/or bongs. Macrame looked like both, and was smiled upon. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sand Candles</SPAN><BR>
The great thing about seventies craftwork was that it took the work of centuries of artisans and made it easy, accessible, and stupid. The idea with these tchotchkes was that you poured hot wax into a sand hole and got a candle encrusted with sand. As far as I know, nobody had previously longed for household items that looked like the bottom of someone's foot, but you could do it yourself, and thus it contained love. Sand-encrusted love. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Driftwood Sculpture</SPAN><BR>
I can get into the shape of driftwood, but I can't get into the idea of calling the practice of selecting a piece and covering it with shellac "sculpture." Worse than that is making it into a coffee table. Disco may have been ugly, but at least it wasn't made of driftwood. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">God's Eyes</SPAN><BR>
In terms of complexity, God's eyes make lanyards look like renal surgery, but I enjoyed them because while they weren't exactly a thrill a picosecond, they could be completed within my famously short attention span. Making a God's eye involved running cheerfully-hued yarn around popsicle sticks until you got something that I can only hope -- but not, presumably, pray -- looks nothing like God's actual eyes. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Sloth</BIG></SPAN><BR>
I'm big on sloth. Sloth is cheap, and easy to get.
You need a partner or at least an object to get the most out of lust,
gluttony and avarice
both take something of a financial investment, but sloth is damned
convenient. You can get in some quality sloth in your own bedroom,
watching TV or even at
the office. And if anyone gives you a hard time about it, just point out
that by doing nothing, you're helping to slow down the endless
march of entropy and delay the eventual heat death of the universe. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Gluttony</BIG></SPAN><BR>
Most people group sloth and gluttony together as the Slob Sins,
but the
fact is that your dedicated glutton puts a lot of effort into his or her sin.
Finding the stores with the pillowcase-sized bags of potato chips, checking
out which lunch buffets shut down at 2:00 and which go on until 3:30, taping
Nabisco commercials--gluttony can be hard work.
Take time out to give a glutton you know a pat on the back and a
bite of your sandwich, just to say "Hey, thanks for being a glutton." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Wrath</BIG></SPAN><BR> Lousy sin. Unsociable, bad on the nerves, and 
drives property values
down. And what do you have to show for it? An ulcer and bruised
knuckles, that's what. And it's so vulgar. 
Take it from me, pass on the wrath. Not only
will you be less damned, you'll be happier. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Lust</BIG></SPAN><BR>
Ah, lust. Putting the "deadly" back into the Seven Deadly Sins. The
nasty thing is that while you need to trade liquids to get dead from lust,
all you have to do to be damned to eternal hellfire and torment is lust in
your heart. Talk about insult to injury. I lust in my heart all the time--
heart, brain, endocrine glands, the whole shebang. Even if I WANTED to not
lust, I'm
not sure how I'd go about it. Still, of all the deadly sins, this one is
its own reward. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Pride</BIG></SPAN><BR>
I'm not sure how this one works. Is plain old everyday
pride sinful or do you have to get into the realm of hubris before you're in
trouble? Do you go to hell for saying "this is a pretty tasty three-bean
salad I've made, if I do say so myself," or do you have to say "why, I bet
this is a better three-bean salad than GOD could make"? And what about
self-esteem? My high school counselors were always pushing self-esteem on
me. Were they pawns of the Adversary? So many questions. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Envy</BIG></SPAN><BR>
This is another of those thinking sins. Do you get damned for THINKING
about another slice of pie? Do you burn for CONSIDERING hitting the snooze
alarm? No, of course not, but all you have to do is covet something of
someone else's and
boom, you're a brimstone hors d'oeuvre. You don't have to lay a HAND on your
neighbor's manservant to get the ecclesiastical zot. There should really be
some sort of appeals process. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"><BIG>Avarice</BIG></SPAN><BR>
Also known as greed. Got a lot of good press in the eighties. Still
has a lot of supporters. If gluttony were as popular as greed the snack food
industry would own us all like so much stacked firewood. The problem with
avarice is that it gets pretty ludicrous pretty quickly. From billionaires
buying a dozen gold cadillacs to bozos gushing over costume jewelry on the
Home Shopping Network, greedy people inevitably end up looking goofy in
public. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rocking Chairs</SPAN><BR>
It's wonderful the stupid things we invent to help us deal with nevous tension: rocking chairs, stress balls, anatomically correct vibrating devices, so on and so forth. Rocking chairs are fun, no doubt about it, but they always make me think of grandmothers sitting and rocking and knitting and humming along the the radio. Grandmothers must have a LOT of nervous tension to work out. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lawn Chairs</SPAN><BR>
Another thing I find amazing is how people so often invent things that seem to be carefully calculated to fail at their designed task. Take the lowly lawn chair. It burns your ass on sunny days, moistens your ass on dewy mornings, pokes little holes in your carefully-tended lawn, and tips over if you fall asleep. It would be hard to design a worse outdoor chair without making it irresistably delicious to squirrels. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Movie Theater Seats</SPAN><BR>
Many improvements have been made to movie theater seats over the past decade or so. Too bad they haven't keep up with the degeneration in movie theaters themselves. I appreciate the tilting back and all, but it does me no good if it puts the back of my head in the popcorn barrel of the person behind me. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Barstools</SPAN><BR>
At first glance, you might say that these suffer from the same affliction as lawn chairs, but I think that the unsuitability of barstools for sitting on while drunk is an obvious boon to society. First off, falling of your stool and knocking it over when you get up convinces you that you're drunker than you are, reducing the number of drunk drivers on our nation's sidewalks. Secondly, they allow you to recognize the "seasoned wetbrains" (to quote Dorkin) in the bar: they manage to slump with a perfect sense of balance. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bean Bags</SPAN><BR>
The reason these are so popular in dorm rooms and neo-hippy households is because the encourage contemplation -- profound thoughts like "If God is omnipowerful and benevolent, why can't I get out of this bean bag?" and "Nobody's noticed me holding out the bong and I can't get up; may as well take another hit." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">High Chairs</SPAN><BR>
Some people think that people like roller coasters because of the adrenalin rush. I think it's because we have suppressed memories of when life was novel and exciting and we were always being strapped into our seats. "Hey, I'm locked in and sitting! That means I'm either being transported someplace new or they're going to give me some food to throw!" Add a tray and a bib to your roller coaster and I bet you'll be breaking attendance records left and right. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snowballs</SPAN><BR>
It's always nice when Mother Nature provides us with something new to
hit people with. And it's considered wholesome violence too, like giving
noogies, so you can usually get away with it. For those of you who don't
like snowball fights, a winter tip: the proper response to an unanticipated
snowball attack is shaking your fists and yelling "You darn kids!" If
you're going to do this, it's also best to wear a top hat. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snowmen</SPAN><BR>
The interesting thing about snowmen to me is that they're always
made in three parts, the abdomen, thorax, and head. I wonder what the
significance of this is, aside from yet another excuse to use the
word "thorax." I suppose it's a vague attempt to model the torso/leg
split in human anatomy, but if so it's pretty sad, considering that
not even the most tragic congenital affliction turns one's legs into
a perfect sphere. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snow Angels</SPAN><BR>
Hey, any art project that involves falling over and flailing
your limbs is okay by me. It kind of makes me wonder what my other
angel-indentation options are. A mud angel is an obvious possibility,
but what really excites me is the thought that I might one day get to
make a <EM>syrup</EM> angel.  Now that'd be a good time. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snow Forts</SPAN><BR>
These are really only of any use if you're having a snowball fight --
it's not like you can invite the neighbors over to watch Galaxy Quest on
DVD -- and frankly, the main attraction of a snowball fight is that it
takes little or no preparation. If we're going to have to put together
armaments and battlements, I say let's just go inside and thumb wrestle. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Food</SPAN><BR>
I've never understood the whole attraction of eating snow. It's
not just that you're eating random stuff that fell outdoors -- if
it rained ham would you eat that? -- it's also that you already
know what it tastes like! Nothing! It's not like one of these years
it's going to have lemon juice squeezed into it. Pleh. <B>D</B></P>

<P><B>Cola</B><BR>
It says something about modern society that our most popular soda doesn't taste like anything in particular. I mean, I imagine there might be a passing resemblance to cola nuts, but I don't know anyone who'd be in a position to verify such. I once read an ingredient list of flavorings that supposedly go into the cola experience, and it was ungodly long and obscure. It made those complex food magazine recipes for stuff like pheasant au goulet--the ones that require you to have a separate knife for each body part of the pheasant and that require you to know that Bulgarian coriander is actually a breed of sheep--look like boxed mac and cheese by comparison. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><B>Lemon-Lime</B><BR>
Actually, there's a wide variety of sodas which I lump carelessly under the "lemon-lime" category with no regard for whether they actually contain lemons and/or limes. Basically, if the bottle and the liquid inside are both greenish, and it's not ginger ale, it's lemon-lime. Fresca is lemon-lime in spite of tasting like grapefruit, and Mountain Dew is lemon-lime in spite of being made out of squeezings from the adrenal glands of snowboarders. <B>C</B></P>

<P><B>Orange</B><BR>
When I was working at McDonald's as a teenager--I had a computer to pay for and some sins from a past life to work out--I noticed a cup of orange soda sitting next to a cup of orange juice. The soda was an intense, bellowing shade of orange, the sort that keeps crossing guards safe. The juice, by comparison, was a limp yellow, the shade of yellow that tells you the arm's going to have to come off. That's when I realized that we, as a culture, have no tolerance for natural colors. We want our whites to phosphoresce, our pinks to vibrate, and our orange soda to humiliate our orange juice. <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>Grape</B><BR>
I actually drink more diet soda than sugar soda, not so much out of  a desire to diet than a desire to not be on a sucrose high every moment of every day. As a lover of all things grape and artificial, I have been constantly disappointed by the difficulty of getting diet grape soda in California. One of the few perks of moving to the South is that you can get diet grape soda here, but only Diet Rite white grape soda, which tastes right, but it's not purple! What, I ask you, is the point? Whom, I ask you, are we fooling? It's grape soda, I neither want nor need it to look good in a champagne flute. <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Cream Soda</B><BR>
I like foods that don't actually contain the ingredients in their name. Grape Nuts don't contain grapes or nuts, cream soda doesn't contain cream, Ritz crackers don't actually contain an upscale hotel, and so forth. The neat thing about cream soda is that it actually tastes vaguely creamy. Vaguely. <B>B</B></P>

<P><B>Root Beer</B><BR>
My big problem with root beer is that someone informed me a while ago that it tastes like toothpaste. I wish she hadn't said that. I had gone some twenty someodd years without noticing the connection, but once I was enlightened, there it was. I still like root beer, sure, but now every time have I have one there's that brief moment of wary recognition. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Asteroids</SPAN><BR>
Asteroids are great. There are so many great things about asteroids
that I'm feeling kind of breathless and dizzy. To begin with, there's
"Asteroids," the video game, a fine example of certain death in a
recursive universe. Then there's the whole shooting star phenomenon,
without which we would have no excuse to use the word "Perseid." And
finally, there are all the movies wherein spaceships are battered like
a weevil in a box of Screaming Yellow Zonkers. The fact that actual
asteroid fields are only slightly more densely populated than Wyoming
dampens my enthusiasm not a whit. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Novae and supernovae</SPAN><BR>
I'm a sucker for anything with an irregular plural, but I'm feeling
somewhat hosed on the supernova front. I suppose I should count myself
lucky; I've gotten to witness the year 2000, the Bicentennial, and the
introduction of shaving gel, but I'd really be jazzed if there were
some sort of bird-confusingly bright supernova destined to appear in
the night skies before I kick this mortal bucket. That would be good. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Comets</SPAN><BR>
Comets have really failed to pull it off recently, should you ask me.
The latest Halley visit was a big yawn, and Hale-Bopp was interesting only
because cultists in name-brand sneakers took it so seriously. Plus every
time one sidles close to our planet we have to listen to well-coiffed news
anchors explain over and over that each is a mass of dirt and ice.  So is
Greenland, but I'm not expected to find <EM>that</EM> fact interesting,
am I? The only really interesting comet recently was the one that was
shredded and absorbed by Jupiter, which just goes to show you: we're rooting
for the planets now. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Quasars</SPAN><BR>
I'm inclined to be positive toward quasars, if only because I play
Scrabble.  So I did a little research and found an interesting
little page on quasars: They're actually massive galaxies which are very
far away, which is interesting enough.  But then I came across <A
HREF="http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/quasars.html#q11">an
explanation</A>
that the total quasaric energy that has actually reached our measuring instruments
is about that needed "for a mosquito to make one 'push-up.'"
A fascinating image to be sure, but that somehow ruined the mystique for
me. I'm sure that in their own sector of the universe they're very 
influential objects, but now whenever I hear "quasar" I can only think
of that one mosquito doing that one push-up. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">GPS Satellites</SPAN><BR>
GPS satellites are nice because they can answer two of the three most common
questions in my life: "What time is it?" and "Where am I?" If they

the bases would be covered. <B>B+</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Speed Racer</SPAN><BR>
What is it that makes Speed so great? Is it his injection-molded
hair? His Swedish-porn-star scarf? The fact that his eyelashes are larger
than most North American songbirds? He looks like a woodland creature,
if woodland creatures bought all their clothes from Fingerhut catalogs
and had poorly synchronized speech. He's the very paragon of glistening
nobility and he has a cool car. He's so <EM>dreamy.</EM> <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Trixie</SPAN><BR>
If Barbie is a poor physical role model for young girls, Trixie is a 
poor physical role model for yearling gazelles. I don't know if her
coffee-stirrer legs and arms were designed to save valuable ink, or
if the head animator had a thing for coat racks or what, but 
nonetheless she's <EM>still</EM> not as pretty as Speed. Is she Speed's
girlfriend? Their relationship seems based not so much on romance as on
her making little worried noises all the time. Soulmate or
designated fretter? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Narrator</SPAN><BR>
The narrative voice isn't as active in the Racer oeuvre as it is
in, say, the Superfriends, but when it does show up it's always
awful. A sampling: "Meanwhile, in a secret hotel room, the
secret head of the Alpha Team, Mr. Wiley, is having a secret meeting."
Frankly, if it's that secret I'm surprised anyone showed up. The only
real purpose the Narrator serves is to say "And here are some bad guys,"
which isn't really necessary, because Speed Racer bad guys all look
distinctively like 1960's joke cocktail napkin characters. <B>D</B></P>


<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Racer X</SPAN><BR>
It's not often you find masked riders at major non-wrestling sporting
events, which is a shame because they inevitably lend a jaunty air to the
proceedings. At any rate, Racer X -- secretly Speed's prodigal brother Rex --
is living proof of the saying "Any crash you can walk away from, disown your
father, leave home, return years later as a masked mystery figure and
nearly accidentally kill your brother in an impromptu night-time car
race is a good one." Profound. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pops Racer</SPAN><BR>
Pops exemplifies Lamarck's Theory of Evolution by Means of Last Name.
Each generation of Racers has gotten better and better at racing;
simulations predict that Speed's great-great grandchild will be
able to break the world land speed record in a Geo Metro. 
If Pops's last name were "Typist" or "Pusher," it would have
been a very different, although probably still inexplicably entertaining,
cartoon. This also explains why you see so few people with the last
names of "Loser," Failure," and "High Insurance Risk." <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Spritle and Chim-Chim</SPAN><BR>
Really, really disturbing. If they didn't wear the same outfits,
or even if the outfits didn't include those Spanky-by-way-of-Dr.-Seuss
skullcaps, I could probably take it. I recognize how essential their
loathsome shenanigans are to the Speed Racer look-and-feel, but I'm hoping
Spritle's hard at work suppressing memories, because otherwise he's going
to have a lot of trouble forming functional relationships later
on in life. "Could you grunt like a monkey, baby? Yeah. Now do a
backflip. Now try to steal my candy. Oh yeah, baby." <B>C</B></P>

Yay for the spider-webbing. I don't care if the web shooters are mechanical, biological, or made of actual live spiders wrapped around the wrist, it's the slinging and swinging that makes Spider-Man the superhero he is. Also, they pretty much nail him as a New York superhero, thanks to the abundance of tall buildings.

The proportional speed of a spider isn't really that impressive. Watching those buggers run, I'd guess about ten or fifteen scale miles per hour, tops. I guess Spidey uses his speed mostly to dodge attacks, and it's hard to say how well a spider would do getting out of the way of a little tiny miniature pumpkin bomb.

<p class="ratingheader">Smokescreen</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Unless you're offroading in an Aston Martin SUV, smokescreens are pretty pointless. "Ahh! Smoke! Where did he go? Maybe right up ahead of us on the road? Seems like a safe bet." I guess you could use your smokescreen in a residential area with lots of intersections, or time it so that you drop the smoke a split second before the traditional Wheeling of the Watermelon Carts And Chicken Trucks Out Into The Street, but it seems like there are better things to spend your spy money on, like those metal testicles you can hang from your rear bumper. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Oil Slick</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This is somewhat less effective since Kremlin scientists invented anti-lock brakes in 1985, but it's still not bad. It makes things crash, and everybody likes crashes. You can light it and then things crash with lots of fire, which is also nice. Finally, if you release the oil, then trick the bad guys into chasing you down the same street after a light rain, it works again. The main problem is that every time you go back to have your oil cartridges refilled, Q tries to sell you a new air filter. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Caltrops</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Spikes! For you! In your tires! Caltrops are probably a more effective tactic than less direct measures, but they have a much lower chance of making a crash, explosion, or long bouncy cliff fall happen, so they don't get as much use as you'd expect. The evil spy villain enforcers just pull over to the side of the road and call the Archenemy Automobile Association. Not at all satisfying. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Machine Guns</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The best part about machine guns is the popping out. They just pop right out of your hood or your tailfins or the giant dead termite on your roof like some sort of robotic meerkat. They make the Generic Mechanical Movie Whirr in the process. You want to wave and yell "Hi, machine guns!" Then they completely shoot you. There's really no down side. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Eject Button</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The eject button has been emasculated by comedy. It's really sad. Most of them may as well be labeled "Wacky Sidekicks Push Here For Laughs." The rest may as well be labeled "Caution: Do Not Press Unless You're A Gullible Bad Guy, In Which Case This Is An Altoids Dispenser." That's why, whenever I see an eject button that's actually used for legitimate ejecting, I send the director a package of Gummi Bears. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Wheel Blades</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These are pretty cool. I guess. I mean, they are blades and all, but they really only fuck up your opponent's paint job. There aren't really any vital parts on the side of a car at wheel level, except actual wheels, and that never works. Leave this one to the chariots. However, wheel blades are probably handy to tell you the distance to the curb, or more precisely to render the point moot. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<P><BIG><B>Cookie Monster</B></BIG><BR>
Cookie is the MAN! Cookie's got it ALL going on! Cookie is 
a huge terry-cloth  mass of greed, gluttony, and astonishing lack of self-restraint, and this is on EDUCATIONAL TV! And Cookie Monster, in his 
Zen-like wisdom, provided my generation with perhaps the only clear moral 
message we'll ever know, a beacon for our scattered lives: "C is for cookie, 
and that's good enough for me." It's good enough for all of us, 
Cookie. <B>A</B></P>  

<P><BIG><B>Elmo</B></BIG><BR>
I know lots of people are enamored of this Muppet-come-lately, and I 
have to admit I have no idea why. Elmo is this completely harmless, 
sweet, friendly toddler-monster, and he bores the hell out of me. He lacks 
the joie de vivre of his predecessors; you'd never see Elmo tearing apart 
huge Styrofoam vowels, yelling angrily at passerby, or even "doing the 
pigeon." Instead of bizarre antisocial behavior and physical comedy, we 
get cute childlike antics and "tickling." Pleh. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Oscar the Grouch</B></BIG><BR>
Mean people may suck, but Oscar rocks. I always enjoyed Oscar's bit 
where he's happy when he's angry and angry when he's happy, but I never knew I'd be emulating him someday. Oscar is another 
example of a character that wouldn't even be considered if Sesame Street 
were being created today. Instead they'd slip some Zoloft in his feed, 
transplant him to a brightly-colored recycled oil-drum, and have him lead 
"Ring Around the Rosie." <B>A-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Ernie and Bert</B></BIG><BR>
Yeah, yeah. Were they just roommates or were they lovers? 
Listen folks, they  were Muppets. They may have had hands up their asses 
but it was purely for puppeteering purposes. Besides, for my money the 
real sexual tension was between Grover and Kermit. Anyhow, Ernie and Bert 
always had the song-and-dance thing down pat. Ernie's Rubber Ducky song is 
the Sesame Street classic, and Bert's "Doing the Pigeon" had similar 
appeal, plus a really unnerving dance move. And then there was the bit 
where their noses got pulled off. Always fun. <B>B</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>The Count</B></BIG><BR>
Man, talk about a twisted personality! Talk about obsessive-compulsive disorder!  Talk about the numbers one through twelve! You 
really couldn't get the Count into any long-term plots because he really 
only did one thing, but he certainly did it well. I think many children 
learned to count purely on the off chance that they could summon thunder 
and lightning by doing so. But I have one  question. The Count looked like 
a vampire, right down to the fangs. And he had the bat thing going. Was he 
a vampire? Did he feed on living blood? Or, more likely given his 
Muppetness, living felt? A horrifying yet oddly appealing idea. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Big Bird</B></BIG><BR>
The name was kind of a gimme. Big Bird is somewhat less twisted 
than most of the Muppets around him, but due to his intimidating size and 
lack of baby-lisp, he doesn't have the repulsive Elmo cuteness. In the 
early days he had a kind of lovable loser image going, with all his 
hallucination, and his calling Mr. Hooper "Mr. Looper," but Hooper/Looper 
took the dirt nap and Snuffy showed himself to everyone, so B.B.'s in a much 
more capable place now. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">New Jersey</SPAN><BR>
New Jersey, in an act of unprecedented chutzpah, has apparently created
a license plate commemorating smog. The perplexing thing is not just that
the fading urine-yellow background looks like grimy smog on a summer day,
but that it's hard to imagine what else it could possibly be meant to
evoke. Even more odd are the special plates that have pictures of things
like an American bald eagle in the smog, a lighthouse in the smog,
and a cute little happy kitty and puppy in the smog. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ohio</SPAN><BR>
Ohio recently changed the slogan on its plates to "Birthplace of
Aviation." North Carolina, being the location of Kitty Hawk, has long
had "First in Flight" as its license plate slogan. Now, I appreciate
wanting to point out that the Wright Brothers were actually from Ohio
and just went to North Carolina for proof-of-concept, but is
America really so devoid of history that we need to double up on our
claims to fame? What's next, "Phildelphia: Where the Wright Brothers
Went For Bagels"? <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader"></SPAN><BR>
Rhode Island
"The Ocean State," this plate proclaims, with a stylized ocean in the
background in case you're saying to yourself "Ocean, ocean...I've heard
that word before, but I can't place it." Anyhow, I think it's sad that
a state is reduced making a big deal out of what it's surrounded by. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">New Mexico</SPAN><BR>
I've always had a spongy bit in my heart for the stylized Pueblo Indian
sun symbol that appears on New Mexico license plates. It's called a
"zia." It's a great glyph and a great word and a great tragedy that it
isn't included in the Scrabble Players Dictionary. Also on the plate is
the phrase "Land of Enchantment," which is a nice sentiment even though
it sounds like a brand of butter. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wyoming</SPAN><BR>
Say what you like about Wyoming, they've got an embossed rodeo cowboy
on their license plate. For some inexplicable reason this strikes me as
good. In fact, "The Embossed Rodeo Cowboy State" would make an excellent
replacement for their current lackluster nickname, "The Equality State." <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Oregon</SPAN><BR>
The Oregon plate has a tree on it. This is called "playing to your
strengths." If there's one thing that Oregon has a lot of it's trees. If
there are two, it's trees and gas station attendants. You can also get
a license plate with a salmon on it, but I'm pretty sure there are more
gas station attendants than there are salmon. But it's not like it's a
competition or anything. Salmon and gas station attendants haven't been
at war since 1972. Sure, there's the occasional flare-up, but by and
large gas station attendants and salmon are able to keep an uneasy truce. <B>C+</B></P>

A nice understated plate in shades of blue depicting a lovely pastoral
farm scene. It makes me think of Iowa as a nice place to move and
raise kids who will hate you. Anyhow, in Iowa you can get a Congressional
Medal of Honor license plate, which is pretty funny. Not only does the
Congressional Medal of Honor represent the highest military award that
can be bestowed on an American, it also means you can get a special
license plate in Iowa! <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">California</SPAN><BR>
I'll admit it, California plates are as dull as a Sacramento nightclub.
Currently they have the state's name in lame-ass scripty letters at the
top, and "SESQUICENTENNIAL - 150 YEARS" at the bottom in accordance
with a state law requiring all government documents to be written in both
English and Moron. Apparently all the talented designers are tapped
to make special plates featuring otters and whale parts. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Alaska</SPAN><BR>
The Alaskan plate commemorates the Klondike Gold Rush, in which people
apparently politely stood in long lines waiting for their turn to get some
gold. At least that's what they're doing on the plate. Not much of a rush,
really, but the Klondike Gold Queue-Up doesn't sound as exciting. Anyhow,
extra points for the "A" made out of a pick and shovel, and for not
explaining what a "Centennial" is. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">North Dakota</SPAN><BR>
Hey, it's got a bison on it! I like bison. Opposite the bison,
there's some sort of plant-like item which some proud North
Dakotan will no doubt explain to me even though I don't care.
The slogan at the bottom is "Peace Garden State" which sounds like
someone just put down the nicest words they could think of,
and at the top it says "Discover the Spirit" which is vague
without being interesting. But I like bison a lot. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">West Virginia</SPAN><BR>
"West Virginia Wild, Wonderful" reads the plate, like a headline
out of a newspaper travel section. I can't really debate this, because
West Virginia is one of those states about which I have no opinion.
As far as I know, it's as wild and wonderful as a magic lemur. If
I wrote it, the slogan would have to be "Sort of Near Washington D.C.,"
so it's just as well the way it is. <B>C</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Michaelangelo's David</p>
<p class="ratingbody">David has become not only the ultimate expression of the classical
ideal of human physical perfection, but in our society it has
become the sole remaining reason we don't just ban nudity outright.
Whenever some country threatens to just outlaw genetalia entirely,
someone points out that art sometimes has a penis. If it weren't for
Michaelangelo's vision, government-sanctioned decency patrols would
even now be breaking into our bedrooms with truncheons and nerve gas. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Chicago Picasso</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Predictably, this statue was controversial when first unveiled.
Many people are accustomed to thinking of public artworks as
featuring primarily pretty things exuding spouts of water, and
this sculpture of a vengeful aardvark god threw them off their
stride. I am told, however, that Chicagoans have come to embrace the
statue as their own, in the same perverse manner that they
embrace insanely cold winters and "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown." <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Laoco&ouml;n and His Sons</p>
<p class="ratingbody">There's a story behind this statue. It involves Poseidon and
the Trojan horse, but the upshot is that this is a statue of three
guys being strangled by a giant sea serpent. The sons in question
are kind of tiny compared to Lacoon himself, which I am led to
understand is to give a sense of perspective when viewed from
the front. I guess I can see that, if I squint. I don't really
like squinting in front of art, though. I'm always concerned
people will think I'm trying to levitate it. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Discus Thrower</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Without a doubt, this is the finest piece of artwork ever created
by a guy named Myron. And so sensibly named, too! That man is definitely
a discus thrower. Kind of a stupid discus thrower considering
how close he's standing to that stump, but nonetheless a thrower of the
discus. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">The Thinker</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This statue is Rodin's gift to the world of sculpture, and
the world of clip art. As a deep and profound symbol of,
uh, a guy thinking, it outshines even the light bulb symbol.
Besides, within a few decades light bulbs will have been replaced by
self-contained fusion panels, but a naked guy giving himself back
problems never goes out of style. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Robotron 2084</SPAN><BR>
Wahoo! Two joysticks! No longer were the sprite-based heroes
of video games limited to shooting in the direction they
were actually headed! Carnage could be handed out like
napkins at an ice cream social! Of course, you weren't doing
this for futuristic jollies, no sir. You had a traditional
family to rescue from scads of evil robots! Unless they were
converted into evil progs, then you had to kill them! Such
is daily life in the world of 2084. <B>A</B></P> 

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tapper</SPAN><BR>
This game, where you played a harried bartender, was one of the
few arcade games to center around beer. Personally,
I think this is one trend that should have continued. We could
be playing Beer Fighter II Alpha and Baldur's Beer Bash now,
but alas such was not to be. They also came out with "Root Beer Tapper",
so that little kids wouldn't grow up to be alcoholics as a result
of pretending to serve beer to cartoon characters. I'm sure
that worked great. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Qix</SPAN><BR>
In this game you played a dot attempting create boxes while avoiding
an evil line. It was pretty abstract. The major controversy surrounding
Qix was of course the proper pronunciation of the name. The proper 
pronounciation was "kicks," but the more common street-level way
to say it was "Quix," which sounds like a 70's breakfast cereal. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Burgertime</SPAN><BR>
Donkey Kong inspired a whole series of scaffolding-based games where
angry bitmaps came after your ass and you had to defeat them
by hitting them with unlikely objects. Burgertime was the best of these,
with the weaponry being huge meat patties, buns, and lettuce leaves,
and the adversaries being eggs and hot dogs who seem to be upset that
they have competition on the cholesterol front. How come nobody's made
a Quake II skin along these lines? <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Defender</SPAN><BR>
This was a pretty complicated game for the time, given that
it had something like five buttons at a time when having
both "Jump" and "Fire" was considered Ph.D. level work.
This was another in the "save the humans from the non-humans"
genre, made all the more fun by the fact that if you
blasted an alien who was carrying a human, the human went into
a graceful plummet, requiring you to swoop down in classic air
adventure style to catch him before he hit the ground in a
lovely spray of individual pixels. <B>A</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Zangief</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm not sure what those red marks on Zangief's body are. If they're scars,
they're pretty fresh. If they're tattoos, they're pretty dumb. My guess
is that they're just the imprints from sleeping in a bed with a dozen
toy trucks. At any rate, Zangief is a wrestler. With so many other
video games involving piledrivers, choke holds, suplexes, duplexes, and
indexes, Zan comes off as kind of dull compared to, say, an electrified
Brazilian man-beast. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Blanka</p>
<p class="ratingbody">You know what I like about Blanka? He learned to electrify his body from
the electric eels. I like the idea that this is something you can just
pick up, like juggling or bellydancing. Maybe I could just take a course
at community college: "Becoming a Deadly Capacitor (Beginner Level),"
which would take place just before my class on playing the recorder and
just after my class on heat vision. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Chun Li</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Chun Li is the only female in the original Street Fighter line-up,
and of course as such she's the subject of many disturbing renditions
of her in various states of undress and distress. If Chun Li were real,
however, she'd probably have something to say to the creators of
these tributes, something along
the lines of "AIEEEE! Death from above!" and then she'd kick them till
they called her mommy. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Vega</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This guy is annoying. First off, he's clearly rifled through a big
stack of Marvel comics for all his ideas, adopting the claws of
Wolverine, the wall-crawling abilities of Spider-Man, Doctor Doom's
mask, and Moon Knight's ability to piss me off. Add to that his
parting line, "Handsome fighters never lose battles" and the
fact that I can't quite, you know, <em>win</em> against him
and you can see why he gets a very personal <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span>.</p>

<p class="ratingheader">M. Bison</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I don't know much about M. Bison, mostly because I can't get to him in
the game, but I do know that Raul Julia portrayed him in the Street
Fighter movie and then died. That's how tough M. Bison is, he can
kill even the people portraying him. I'm not sure if this theory
is sound, we'll have to wait to see if a string of tragedies
befall the cast of <cite>Street Fighter: The Musical</cite> to
find out. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<div class="ratings">
<p class="ratingheader">Dhalsim</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad someone finally exposed the sordid, violent world of yoga. For decades we lived under the misapprehension that yoga practitioners were mostly into stretching and maybe a little bit of not breathing. As it turns out, though, yoga actually involves spitting fire, kicking people from across the room, and doing a stupid little dance when you win. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">E. Honda</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Honda is actually a common family name in Japan, much like General Motors is here. E. Honda is a sumo wrestler who pretty much sucks. Knocking people down with your immense bulk is actually a remarkably effective attack plan in real life, but when your opponents can shoot fireballs and bounce off the walls like so many lotto balls even the Hundred-Hand Slap doesn't get you much. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Ryu/Ken</p>
<p class="ratingbody">These two have the same moves and abilities in the original Street Fighter II game, but Capcom makes up for this by giving them distinct appearaces and personalities. Ryu, the dark-haired one, enjoys collecting art deco lamps and does oil paintings of toy breed dogs in his spare time. Ken, the light-haired one, is very active in local politics and takes great pride in administering the non-profit Ken Fund for the Insufficiently Ass-Kicked. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Guile</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Until recently, I always assumed that Guile's long-distance attack was a wave of static electricity gathered from his hair which, by the way, appears to be crafted from the moustache of a giant surfer. The attack is actually a sonic boom, as evidenced by the voiceover shouting "Sonic Boom," but if you believe the voiceover Ken and Ryu have an attack called "Soy Mucus." In this as in so many things, I like my explanation better. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Balrog</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Interesting triva. In Japan, the names are a bit different, and it's the boxer guy who's called "M. Bison." That's because he looks like Mike Tyson. Bison/Tyson. Those wacky Japanese. Anyhow, Balrog is annoying because he can kick your ass wearing boxing gloves. That's just mean. I like to pretend that they're actually made out of some sort of high-density ceramic material, or at least that they contain horseshoes like in old Bugs Bunny cartoons. It makes me feel better. <span class="ratinggrade">D</p></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Circle</SPAN><BR>
I like "circle," because it provides actual information. You're not
going to say to yourself, "Maybe if I just follow Van Buren Circle I'll
get to the freeway." I would like to apply this principle to other
street names, giving us "Harding Road That Winds Around a Lot Then
Comes to an Abrupt End at the Cannery," and "Coolidge Speed-Bump-Infested
Road That You're Going to Have to Go Down at Fifteen Miles an Hour
Because the Residents Got Tired of High-Schoolers Laying Rubber at
Three in the Morning." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Lane</SPAN><BR>
"Lane" is a nice word, but I think it should only be applied to two-way
residential streets with lots of trees and endearingly asymmetrical
chalked hopscotch squares on the sidewalks. And it can't be used in
Los Angeles. There are no lanes in Los Angeles, unless you count Car
Pool Lane. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Crescent</SPAN><BR>
Now this is just trying too hard. "Crescent" is for city planners
who find "cul-de-sac" too vulgar. What are they trying to evoke here?
The silvery autumn moon? French pastries? A wrench? I don't know
that I've ever seen a crescent-shaped street anyway. Aren't crescents
supposed to be fatter in the middle? I think the word they're
looking for is "Arc." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Avenue</SPAN><BR>
I generally think of Avenues as where you put the car dealerships.
In fact, if I were designing a city, I'd just stick "Car Dealership
Avenue" near a major freeway and that way everyone would know where to
go for Crazy No-Down-Payment Dealin' Days without having to use
Mapquest. Maybe I'd divide it into "West Car Dealership Avenue"
and "East Car Dealership Avenue" just to add a bit of challenge. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Street</SPAN><BR>
I admire "street" precisely because it's so boring. "We're on Tyler
Street. Don't get all worked up, it's just a street." It's an antidote
to living in a society where, in an effort to make boring things sound
interesting, words become less meaningful by the day. For instance,
one would expect "Beanie Baby Headquarters" to indicate the place where
Beanie Babies go to receive instructions and get debriefed, but judging
from the signs on about two dozen local stores, it now just means "A
place where one can buy Beanie Babies." <B>A</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stop</SPAN><BR>
It's the regulatory street sign everyone can enjoy! Fans of law
and order love its no-nonsense authoritarian message,
free of silhouettes and other namby-pamby kowtowing to
illiterate and non-English-speaking drivers, and free-thinking
activists enjoy pasting phrases like "EATING MEAT" or 
"NOT FREEING MUMIA" at the bottom. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Slippery When Wet</SPAN><BR>
I find this sign oddly soothing. Perhaps it's because
the driver looks so placid and generic, in spite of the
fact that his or her car is moving around like a Nerf
ball in a jacuzzi. It's as if the sign is saying
to me "Slippery when wet or icy, but you're going to
be just fine, Tiger." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scenic Route</SPAN><BR>
An interesting idea in principle, but it doesn't work too
well in practice. For instance, near where I live there's
a lovely stretch of highway that goes right along the West
Coast. You can see crashing breakers, frolicking pelicans,
lovely beaches, and other things that the gods put on
earth to prop up the postcard industry. And at some point
along this highway there's a marker that says "Begin Scenic
Route." Suddenly you're in the land of <EM>government approved</EM>
beauty. I refuse to take advice on California scenery from
anyone who chooses to live in Sacramento. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Deer Xing</SPAN><BR>
Pretty good. Straightforward, dynamic icon, only one
problem: the antlers are on backwards. They really are.
You'd think that the government would provide its icon
designers with reference material, but apparently that's
a little too much to ask. I suppose we should just be
grateful the Ped symbols don't have three arms. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Gas Food Lodging</SPAN><BR>
Of the Highway Trinity I like
lodging the best. The circa 1957 design of the pump
for "gas" is nice, and the fork and knife is refreshingly
ironic, considering that most highway-side dining establishments
would be better represented by a french fry box and a
Mulan toy, but lodging wins because the icon looks like
it should stand for "Warning: Giant Cocktail Onion and
Twinkie Rest Area." <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Pineapple</B><BR>
I feel bad for pineapple topping. It's the Zeppo Marx of ice cream toppings. Nobody ever says "Wow! We ran out of pineapple topping in a hurry," and if they did nobody would say "Darn!" I've had the stuff maybe twice in my life, and that much is only from when I've had a three-scoop sundae and a twisted need for variety. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><B>Hot Fudge</B><BR>
The hot here is very important, and not just for viscosity purposes. The differences in temperature, texture and intensity combine to create a fleeting work of dairy art that engages the palate like dirty words at the moment of orgasm which fades into a gooey bowl of missed chances if not seized. Luckily I eat fast. <B>A</B></P>

<P><B>Cherry</B><BR>
I like maraschino cherries. Seeing one atop my sundae reassures me that I live in luxury. Making a sundae without one is like singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and stopping right before "dream." No amount of mastery can make up for what's not there. When I became an adult I tried putting extra cherries on my sundaes, but no, that's not right either. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><B>Chocolate Jimmies</B><BR>
I would like these if they tasted a damn thing like chocolate. Every chocolate jimmy I've eaten has tasted like the non-chocolate jimmies, which is to say crunchy sugar. I can see why crushed Oreos have made such headway in the past two decades. <B>D</B></P>

<P><B>Whipped Cream</B><BR>
Call me a spoiled asshole, but it's the rare ice cream shop that makes whipped cream with a whisk that gets my business. Aerosol whipped cream is fine and dandy but it's essentially the parsley of dessert -- more there for appearances than for flavor. Hand-whipped cream is almost like mousse, thick and textured enough to smother mice, a perfect transition from the ice cream as long as you don't think about the mouse thing too much. <B>D</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Aquaman</B></BIG><BR>
Let's face it, Aquaman basically got suck for powers. His major shtick 
was the whole concentric-ring-exuding fish-control thing which allowed him to 
draft underwater lifeforms into his own personal war, which of course required 
the writers of the show to work a major marine disaster into every ensemble 
piece. This demonstrates a central flaw in including Aquaman on the 
team: having water-based powers is a pretty serious limitation, along the 
lines of a hero whose powers only work on weekends. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Batman</B></BIG><BR>
Batman gets extra points for having the best line in the entire 
history of the Superfriends. The villain was named Dr. Noah Tall or something 
equally ludicrous, and he and his evil little sidekick were posed as 
street-corner food vendors with a cart and everything. As part of their plan, 
they were attempting to get Batman to buy some chicken soup. This REALLY 
HAPPENED, DAMMIT! Anyhow, Batman, the dark night detective, the scourge of the 
underworld, assessing the situation with his keen crime-fighting brain, asks, 
in his deep, stentorian voice, "Is the chicken soup fresh?" It was a glorious 
moment. <B>A</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Superman</B></BIG><BR>
Oh, what are you going to say about Superman? He's got it all going 
on. It's really good that he's such a nice guy, because if I was in Superman's 
place, I'd be totally lording my powers over all the other Superfriends. "Hey 
Batman," I'd say, "Nice utility belt! Got anything in there that would help 
you lift an oil tanker? I didn't think so. Hey Aquaman! You realize I could 
pretty much kick ass over any sea creature you cared to summon, don't you? 
Wonder Woman! Your magic lasso makes me tell the truth: You suck!" So I 
suppose we should be grateful. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Wonder Woman</B></BIG><BR>
Wonder Woman was kind of a grab bag of powers and equipment, 
as if she had picked everything up from the superhero equivalent of the 
Sharper Image Catalog. She had the Bullet-Reflecting Bracelets ($29.95), the 
Mind-Control Lasso ($38.95) and of course the Invisible Plane ($150,000 plus 
taxes and license fees). That last one always got to me. It's like a regular 
plane, only it's invisible. It doesn't make HER invisible, though. So instead 
of this big plane, you see a nice, inconspicuous, flying, squatting 
woman. Huh. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Zan and Jayna</B></BIG><BR>
I don't know if it was ever fully explained why Wendy and 
Marvin were replaced by Donny and Marie Osmond in Spock ears, but then 
Wendy and Marvin's presence was never adequately explained in the first 
place. Zan and Jayna were a definite improvement, because not only were 
neither of them named "Marvin," they also had cool powers. Zan's ability to 
turn into water objects would have been a bit lame if not for the ice 
sculpture loophole, but Jayna definitely was happening with her animal 
transformation. Could have done without that Gleek organism, though. 
<B>C+</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Wendy and Marvin and Wonder-Dog</B></BIG><BR> 
What? What? Why are these losers hanging out 
with the Superfriends? Did they win some sort of lame-ass contest? Are they 
somebody's cousins? Wendy didn't even TRY to fit in with the superhero 
crowd, and the best Marvin could do was a towel around his neck and a T-shirt 
that said "M." And then there was the dog. There's something really sad in the 
fact that the Superfriends were hanging out with Scooby-Doo wannabees for so 
long. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Flight</SPAN><BR>
This sounds like a really raccoon power to have. Aside from the
pure adrenaline rush, there's also the ability to get home from
bars without catching a bus. My guess, however, is that the whole
navigation thing would be a problem for me. I can never tell
an aqueduct from the Astrodome when I'm in a plane -- once I'm high enough
not to be taken out by telephone wires and overpasses, I'm 
going to lose track of where I am pretty quickly. Supes probably
has some sort inherent Super-Nav system, but I'd have to carry around
a GPS, making me a candidate for the Legion of Geeky Justice. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Super Strength</SPAN><BR>
I'd dig on super strength. It's handy for so many purposes, from
serious task completion to showing the hell off. However, there's
one thing that would give me serious pause about signing up for
this: friends moving. If you've ever owned a pickup
truck you know how it is to have random acquaintances suddenly claim
"best buddy" status when they have to move. With super strength,
I figure you can square that and add twelve. "Superman? It's Jimmy.
Say, I'm moving this weekend and I was wondering if you could help.
Hey, there's a six of Burgie in it for you!" <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Heat Vision</SPAN><BR>
Okay, in a bad-guy or welding context, this is really handy. But 
in real life, I don't know. I mean, there's not much you can do with
heat vision that you can't accomplish with a microwave or a lighter
and a gas-soaked rag. Sure, it'd make a nifty party trick, doing 
"Plastic Army Guy Death Scene Theatre," but in the long run I think
it'd be much less useful than, say, being able to pack grocery bags
really well. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">X-Ray Vision</SPAN><BR>
Okay, let's leave aside the question of
what it would be like to <EM>have</EM> X-ray vision, and look at
what it would be like to <EM>know someone</EM> with X-ray vision.
Wouldn't that be eerie? "You have some spinach on your teeth. No,
the back ones." If I were Lois Lane during that balcony scene, I'd
be saying "Hey, fuck you!" at several points during the
conversation. But then I never ask people to tell
me what color panties I'm wearing outside of strictly controlled
psychological tests. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Invulnerability</SPAN><BR>
Not much of a downside to this, as long as you're also invulnerable
to things you might want to get a shot for. And your hair and
fingernails aren't invulnerable. And you're not planning on getting
into the piercing and tattooing scene. And your skin doesn't have
the texture of cold bicycle tires as a result. But given these important
caveats, being able to throw yourself at, in front of, or off of things without
fear of consequences has many practical everyday uses. Hailing cabs,
for instance. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Super Breath</SPAN><BR>
Yes, Superman has super breath. He can inhale and exhale large amounts
of air without swelling up like Daffy Duck connected to a bicycle pump.
We're dealing here with a man who can travel between the stars, who can
change the course of mighty rivers, who can, in certain incarnations,
reverse the flow of time itself. When does this guy encounter a problem
that leaves him with no recourse but to breathe on it?  At any rate,
any potential uses are automatically offset by the fact that
it's called "super breath." <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sushi Boats</SPAN><BR>
A charming yet unsettling idea; little carved boats that
go around a moat. People sit at the bar, and reach into the boats when
they see one loaded with the particular fish treat they desire. You'd
think that such a neat idea would spread to other forms of cuisine like
buffalo wings and jalape&ntilde;o poppers, but a heat lamp would probably ruin
the effect. The main problem: you try eating a small truckload of raw
fish while watching boats go around and around and around and around
and around and around. It's not an exercise for the delicate or those
inclined to vertigo. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Wasabi</SPAN><BR>
This is a green substance that apparently took a childhood vow to
destroy mucus membranes wherever they may be found. A violently flavorful
paste, it makes a nice accent in reasonable doses, but many sushi-positive
guys use it to impress women, in spite of the conspicuous absence of the
phrase "must snort horseradish like it was the sweet scent of morning
lilacs" in "Women Seeking Men" personal ads. Still, if you're in the
mood to convince yourself that you're God's gift to macho displays of
emotional grit, too much wasabi is a smarter way to go about it than,
say, nude shark pummeling. <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sake</SPAN><BR>
"Warm wine! How silly! People from other cultures certainly do
amuse!" Shut up. A society that produces Zima has no right to criticize
the booze of other lands. Sake is a delight, combining the best aspects of
white wine and hot toddies, and sushi is best eaten half-drunk anyway. The
little cups are fun, too, allowing you to toast and gulp, toast and gulp,
until you find yourself ordering the live gecko roll just for the heck
of it. <B>B+</B>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Plastic Sample Sushi</SPAN><BR>
This is another sushi restaurant feature that would work 
well in other venues. Wouldn't you like to be able to see
the latest McDonald's burger strain in glistening 3-D,
rather than buying it based on the macro-zoom photos
they typically put up, the ones that make it look as if
their sandwiches are about the size of a couch? With well-made
plastic sample burgers, you'd have a much better idea of what you're
getting into. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sushi Itself</SPAN><BR>
Okay, it's time for the Brunching Shuttlecocks Hint
Corner. Tired of hiding behind wimpy California rolls and cucumber
maki? Ready to order something that all timid friends wouldn't touch with
a three-meter chopstick, but not quite up for the raw fish experience?
Repeat after me: unagi. Oo-NAH-gee. First off, it's cooked. Secondly,
it's braised with a pleasant teriyaki-esque sauce. Close your eyes and
pretend it's a fish stick. Here's the catch. It's eel. But don't let
you bother you. At least it's cooked and once you're ready to admit to
yourself that you've eaten eel, a little raw tuna will seem like a stroll. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">2000</SPAN><BR>
Oh, great. Yet another Y2K product tie-in. At least I assume that's
what it is. Maybe it's just supposed to be one-fiftieth as good as
a Hundred Grand Bar. The package says "Sparkles in your mouth," which
I made the mistake of taking metaphorically. Apparently the chocolate is
infused with some sort of Pop-Rock-esque material that wakes up just as
the candy is on its way down, giving the startling impression of a small
army of clicking pixies marching down the back of your throat. Startling,
that is, if you're expecting it. If you're not expecting it, it's more
accurately described as freaking freaky. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Daim</SPAN><BR>
After the mouth sparkling of 2000, I was highly suspicious of the
Daim packaging, which depicts the logo breaking in half. Maybe, I
thought, this is the fun candy that snaps your neck in two. Luckily
for me, it's just a nondescript toffee candy with marginally superior
chocolate and an ingredient list in approximately seventy languages. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Plopp</SPAN><BR>
This is chocolate with a gooey licorice center. And not red licorice,
either. No, this is European black licorice, which contains extra
salt. Chocolate and salty black licorice. Those of you who aren't
making little throw-up signals with your fingers are probably already
desperately trying to figure out how to order Plopp online, because you
are demented. Anyhow, to the right-thinking people who find the very
idea of salty choco-licorice abhorrent, it's not actually as horrid as
it sounds. It's merely bad. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mj&ouml;lk Choko</SPAN><BR>
This is pretty uninteresting. More chocolate-covered toffee. I suspect
it was included in the package solely because of the umlaut. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Viol Tabletter</SPAN><BR>
These come in little black candy nuggets, so I figured I was in for
more perverted licorice. But no, these are in essence violet-flavored
JujyFruit. Little chewy sugary chunks that taste like a flower. Or rather,
like what a flower smells like. It's very tasty! I'm not entirely used
to the flavor of violet seeping down my throat, but it should keep the
clicking pixies happy, at least. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Swedish Fish</SPAN><BR>
There weren't any in the package, but I just wanted to go on record
saying that Swedish fish are Wotan's gift to the candy-inclined. Especially
the red ones. They're red, they're sugary, they're shaped like fish. What
more could you want? <B>A+</B></P>

<BR>
<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Scissors</SPAN><BR>
These strike me as a bit of a "show-off" item,
packed in there just to show off that innovative
Swiss design. ("See? It's sproingy!") They don't
look strong enough to cut anything heavier than
paper, and I don't hear a lot about people trapped
in the woods, forced to clip coupons to survive.
But it <EM>is</EM> sproingy. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Leather Awl</SPAN><BR>
Why is this a standard feature? I've never used
it, I've never known anybody who used it, and
I have no idea why it has a hole in the middle.
I'm sure there are people out there who rely
on the leather awl to get them through another 
day of selling cheap bodices to Ren Faire attendees,
but they've got to be in the minority. So why
the ubiquity of what most people probably think of
as "The Mystery Tool"? <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bottle Opener</SPAN><BR>
This is handy. I think there are more people out there
who use their SWAs to pop open a refreshing, domestically-produced
brew than use the leather awl, fish scaler, and toothpick combined.
I can never find my regular bottle opener anyway; I think it's built
into a spatula or a cheese grater somewhere in my kitchen,
but I can never remember where, so this is a great thing
to have even at home. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Big Blade</SPAN><BR>
The blade defines a Swiss Army Knife. It's right there in
the name: "Knife." Even if you don't use the blades, without them
the tool becomes a "Swiss Army Multi-Function Utility
Thinger," which lacks panache. At the same time, the
blade unnerves me. It doesn't lock in place, and it closes
with such a resolute snap that I don't think I've ever put the
blade away without some over-imaginative portion of my
mind (The Stephen King Lobe) picturing my poor, unprotected
finger trapped like a chicken neck under a hatchet. Maybe
that's why they make them out of stainless steel. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Corkscrew</SPAN><BR>
I love this. It's so European. I picture a survivalist sommelier,
living off the land, with only a bold yet elegant Bordeaux
and maybe a light Chardonnay to keep body and spirit together.
And it makes picnics so picnicky. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Toothpick</SPAN><BR>
This seems like padding. "What the hell, let's
tuck a shard of plastic into the case and call it a toothpick.
Now we can say it has ten different functions without having
to count 'ballast.'" It's not like it's tough to improvise
a toothpick from natural materials, if you're not fastidious.
And if you are fastidious, you're probably not going to be
too big on the idea of a re-usable toothpick that's been hanging
out in someone's pocket, no matter how neatly tucked away it is.

<P>
<BIG><B>Darth Vader</B></BIG><BR>
There's nothing to say. Darth is it. He's the 800 pound gorilla of the
Force, Mister Lightsaber himself, the Dark Lord of the Sith. He's got
the Admiral-choking power, the kick-ass mask, the intimidating rasp,
the jet-black TIE fighter, and the James Earl Jones voiceovers. I don't
care what Obi-Wan says, this is a man who made some good career choices.
<B>A+</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Grand Moff Tarkin</B></BIG><BR>
It's hard to take a villain seriously when he has "Moff" in his title.
Tarkin was nasty enough with his deeply etched scowl and his Aryan stride, 
and obviously he had enough going for him that Vader didn't give him the
old long-distance esophagus handjob, but when the chips were down and Red Five
was going in, he made the Bad Choice. Vader cleverly managed to survive the
destruction of the Death Star and still come out looking like a total stud,
but El Moff Grande just ended up as the third cinder from the left in the upper
right hand corner of your screen. <B>C</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Stormtroopers</B></BIG><BR>
"Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise," said Obi-Wan in one of his
less stunningly accurate pronouncements. Obi must have gotten a little too
much sun during his Tattooine holiday, because as the rest of the movie shows
Imperial Stormtroopers couldn't hit the sidewalk with a can of paint. If that's
not bad enough, they're also easily intimidated and dumber than monkey chow. 
Still, they've got nifty uniforms and there's buttloads of them, so they make
excellent fodder for the good guys. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Boba Fett</B></BIG><BR>
Another from the mask-and-armor school of villainy, Boba Fett had a lot
going for him. Not only did he pack lots of cool gadgets like grappling
hooks and a jet pack, he also had the wherewithal to track down Han Solo.
Fett was the only one who didn't fall for the old "drift away with their
garbage" trick, and thanks to that he was the one to deliver the Hansicle to
Jabba and stick around for the party. Unfortunately now he's doing the 
new definition of pain and suffering thing in the Sarlacc pit. <B>B</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Jabba the Hutt</B></BIG><BR>
"Hutt" is right up there with "Moff" in the list of "words it's best not
to have in your name if you want to be intimidating." Jabba actually lacks
a lot of qualities necessary to be a really first-rate bad guy. Mobility
is one of them. Lack of resemblance to escargot is another. He's got 
some mean pets and interesting ideas for torture, but he's really too 
party-oriented to make it as a villain. I mean, could you take out Vader 
using only a length of chain while wearing a metal bikini? I think 
not. <B>C</B></P>

<P><BIG><B>Sandpeople</B></BIG><BR>
I was never able to figure out whether "Tusken Raiders" referred to the
fact that they had little tusk-like thingies on their masks, or if they
were from a town called Tusken or what. They were mean, though, with the
scary faces and the rags for clothes and the Gaffi sticks with the spikes
on the end and the big furry elephants to stomp the unassuming homes of hapless
moisture farmers. But then, all you have to do is learn to make that noise
that Ben Kenobi made and they're off like rabbits, even in mid-clobber,
which kind of cuts down on their effectiveness. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sweet</SPAN><BR>
Sweet is good. Not only is it a good way to manipulate children, without
it we'd be forced to sing that our romantic partners are  stickier
than honey. A compelling image, certainly, and an admirable goal,
but not the sort of thing that wins the heart of a coy shepherdess in
renaissance poetry. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Bitter</SPAN><BR>
Bitter can be tough to defend. After all, restaurants and coffee bars
don't keep a jar of baking soda around in case your order isn't quite
bitter enough for your tastes. On the other hand, some of the finest
ingestibles in the world have flavors that tumble around like those
weird-ass electric rolling ferret toys on a foundation of unapologetic
bitterness: coffee, beer and semisweet chocolate. Given that most Ratings
are written under the influence of at least two of those three items,
I can only be so critical. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sour</SPAN><BR>
Sour just doesn't live up to the hype. The candy syndicates present it
as the meth of the swingset set, a dangerous substance that only those
who are brave and willing to have their tongues unroll from their mouths
like tickets from a Skee-Ball game should dare to mess with. But really,
kids, this is the same flavor being pushed by middle-aged storks on
pickle jars. Wise up. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Salt</SPAN><BR>
I'm not a salt fiend under normal circumstances, unlike, say, the
Dutch. They're insane that way. They combine salt and black licorice,
and seem to consider the resulting substance edible. Then they go ahead
and do it again, this time with double the salt. I had one of the latter
monstrosities at a sadistic candy shop once. It came in a glossy little
disk of evil and I'm pretty sure that when I put it in my mouth it
burrowed into my skull and is gestating there still. It makes me itch
sometimes late at night. Um. Anyhow, salt's pretty cool, especially when
combined with some variety of grease. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Umami</SPAN><BR>
This is the "new" flavor. Apparently they've decided that monosodium
glutamate has its own special way of spreading happiness, and thus
doesn't fall under the normal taste categories emblazoned on tongue
charts in biology classes across the nation. I have to admit that my main
experience with MSG has been indifferent notice of Chinese restaurant
menus assuring me that they don't use it, so I can't tell you whether
it's entirely worthwhile, but I will tell you I'm unnerved that they're
adding taste categories. I'm just afraid that the big corporations are
going to start funding research, and before you know it General Foods
will be informing us that they've identified the "Cool Ranch" receptor. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Turkey</SPAN><BR>
When you get right down to it, turkey is not a bad choice for a feast 
holiday. Turkeys are low fat, reasonably gigantic, and they make good 
cartoon characters for holiday specials. What cracks me up is the 
supposed scientific finding that gets bandied about this time of year 
that says that turkey contains a chemical that makes you sleepy, as if 
the people who had ham instead are out roller blading after dinner. 
When you consume your weight in buttered foodstuffs, you're going to 
feel a bit nappish, turkey or no turkey. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Canned Cranberry Sauce</SPAN><BR>
There are many excellent uses for cranberries and cranberry juice, many 
of them involving vodka. However, the canned tribute to the Gods of 
Pectin that gets served at many Thanksgiving tables pretty much 
leeches the appeal right out of the suckers. Look at it this way: when 
was the last time you heard anyone say "Boy, we should have bought 
more canned cranberry sauce," or "Yay! There's leftover canned 
cranberry sauce!" Now, I'm sure there are many people out there who 
are saying to themselves "Ay! The canned cranberry sauce is my 
favorite part of Thanksgiving!" These people are perverts. 
<B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Candied Yams</SPAN><BR>
Interestingly enough, studies I just made up show that your average 
person does not, except on Thanksgiving, eat (a) anything candied, or 
(b) anything made of yams. I imagine the Yam Council and the 
Candification Board are working hard to change this, but I have a better 
idea for increasing candied yam awareness: make the phrase a slang 
term for the gonad portion of the male anatomy. Think about it. The 
increase in groin humor in the movies and television has created an 
ever-increasing need for euphemisms for same, and if I can contribute 
even a single line to a Mighty Ducks sequel, I can die a happy man. 
<B>B-</B>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pumpkin Pie</SPAN><BR>
This is, without question, the most noble thing you can do with a 
gourd, and it's among the most pleasurable. I have childhood memories 
of my mother transforming our Halloween pumpkin into our 
Thanksgiving pumpkin pies, which is heartwarming and all until you 
realize that carved pumpkins start to look pretty grotesque by Veteran's 
Day, so I'm hoping this is just part of the same false memory syndrome 
that lead me to believe that my father invented the cheeseburger in 1975. 
Anyhow, pumpkin pie. Good stuff. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mashed Potatoes</SPAN><BR>
This is one of the two essential Thanksgiving items that actually gets 
eaten throughout the year, the other being "bread." I really dig on 
mashed potatoes. I would love to travel back in time and shake the hand 
of the man or woman who invented mashed potatoes, in spite of the 
very real risk that I'd end up shattering the flow of time, making it so that 
my parents never met, invalidating my own existence, and creating a 
temporal rift that would result in a world where ficus trees rule the earth. 
And then I'd do the same thing with the person who invented 
<EM>garlic</EM> mashed potatoes. <B>A+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stuffing</SPAN><BR>
Another sign of the holidays are the cheery warnings in the Food 
section of your local newspaper
which tell you that if you cook your stuffing <EM>inside</EM> the 
turkey, you may as well put a sign in your upper intestine saying "Evil 
Bacteria Wanted. Toxic Biological By-Products a Plus." Apparently, in 
spite of the fact that turkeys need to be cooked in a hot oven for hours, 
this isn't enough to stop stuffing
bacteria, which kill three billion people every year. So if you live in one 
of the states that still allows internally cooked stuffing, you can add a 
certain adventurous quality to your holiday meal by defying the odds 
and blazing your own flavored bread trail.  <B>B</B></P>

<p class="ratingheader">Turkeys</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The nice thing about turkeys is that they vaguely resemble a child's outstretched hand. Clearly, there is no stronger argument for an intelligent designer of the universe than the fact that, when Thanksgiving comes around and authoritarian art must be created in the nation's elementary schools, the students need only trace their off hand with a washable marker to create an instantly recognizable Thanksgiving icon, modulo the beak and wattle of course. It's also interesting that so many of our images of Thanksgiving turkeys involve them <em>not</em> being killed, plucked, and eaten. The President pardons a turkey, cartoon turkeys on TV manage to avoid the axe, but when it comes to the actual dead turkey on our table, pass the gravy.<span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

Dried Indian corn is clearly on the "look but don't lick" side of the equation, and it bothers me that the corn we display and the corn we digest are not the same corn.

Were they actual head fasteners or did the Pilgrims just have this whole belt <em>theme</em> happening, kind of like Lulu from Final Fantasy X, only with less cleavage and more threshing? Buckles or no buckles, Pilgrims signify one of the most important aspects of Thanksgiving: remembering those who fled religious oppression so that they could finally live free to oppress others for once in their lives.

That sort of thing is only paradisical if you were born on a hippie commune and never left.

By dropping five bucks on mass-produced cardboard autumn leaves, we reassert ourselves as a first-world country, not one of those icky places where the leaves in your living space are the result of the natural actions of gravity and wind. Also, I think fear of Lyme disease may be a factor. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chrissy</SPAN><BR>
Suzanne Somers just won't go away, will she? But before the Buttmaster,
before the Thighmaster, before the Suzanne Somers Show and She's the Sheriff
there was Christmas "Chrissy" Snow, capturing the hearts and "minds"
of the sort of people who found Marilyn Monroe movies too intellectual. 
Without her, the show would have been nothing more than a genteel sitting-room 
comedy of the type so loved by the Edwardian British, and indeed her departure
signaled the beginning of the end for this lovable space that needs your
face. And hey, how many women can claim to have single-handedly set the 
feminist movement back 20 years? <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Janet</SPAN><BR>
Where Chrissy taught us that you can be a bimbo and still rake in the bucks
hawking dubious athletic equipment on infomercials, Janet provided the good
news that just because you're dark-haired and assertive doesn't mean you
can't be treated like bargain-counter meat as well. In fact, one of the central
messages of Three's Company is that <EM>everyone</EM> can get leered 
at in public.  Except, perhaps, for Mister Furley. But we'll get to
him in a bit. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Larry</SPAN><BR>
Wisecracking Mercutio to Jack's Romeo, philosophical Horatio to Jack's madcap
Hamlet, Larry was an every-jerk who served the incredibly important
purpose of making all the other spongebrains on the roster look good by
comparison. I mean, let's face it, nobody on "Three's Company" is exactly a 
supernova of taste and charisma. By and large they make the Sweathogs look 
like the cultural elite. Next to Larry, though, they blossom into borderline
non-loserhood. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Jack</SPAN><BR>
Am I the only one who noticed that "Jack Tripper" is a sort of
anagrammy acrostic thingie for "Jack T[he] Ripper"? One more
subliminal gambit in the International Sitcom Conspiracy, but it
gave the whole show a disturbing air, as if the season finale might
involve a crawlspace and the phrase "Hunter of the Lord." Anyhow.
Jack, I think, provided the only legitimate cultural truth in the
series. To wit: if you can cook really well, you can get away with
anything. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mr. Furley</SPAN><BR>
This must have been quite a stretch for Don Knotts, having to break out
of his usual role of lemur-eyed backwater twit on the edge on an
aneurysm to play a suburban, bandana-wearing lemur-eyed twit on the
edge of an aneurysm. I imagine there's probably a whole cohort of 
Roper partisans out there who see Furley as a landlord-come-lately,
sort of a George Lazenby of bedroom farce, but Knotts is the
one with the range. He's played a cartoon fish, for God's sake! A lemur-eyed
cartoon fish on the edge of an aneurysm, to be fair, but still, I'd like
to see Norman Fell try <EM>that</EM> one. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Ropers</SPAN><BR>
Who in the name of the Roman God of Spin-offs thought that anyone
wanted to see a half-hour dedicated to these people? On the
show they were passable second bananas, keeping comedic tensions high
by threatening to toss Jack out on this corduroy-encased ass if he
showed any signs of heterosexuality, but whatever meager laughs they
contributed were due solely to their sheer awfulness. Take a completely
repulsive couple, the male of which is constantly fending off sexual
advances of the female, put them in their own show, and what do you
get? Well, "Married With Children," actually. All the more reason
to abhor them. <B>D</B></P>

The fact that "Lion-O" is such a lame name as to make He-Man
look like Harrison Ford by comparison? The really sad thing
is that his furry pals seem to be unable to accomplish much without
him, or more accurately without his sword. Many episodes follow
the basic plot of "Lion-O is off somewhere being distracted while
the Mutants attack. The ThunderCats fail to defend themselves in
spite of the fact that the Mutants have shown themselves to have
all the competency of a dead computer superstore employee. Lion-O
makes his way back, uses his sword to summon theme music, and
defeats the Mutants with the Generic Blue Beam of Justice. Then
he says something marginally coherent and they all laugh." Not
exactly epic quality. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Tygra</SPAN><BR>
Wasn't Tygra one of the two girls who liked the cars that go boom
in the eighties? That would  be welcome news, because at least
that would establish some sort of personality for this, the
blandest mammal on Third Earth. After repeated viewings, I
was still unable to determine any attitudes, preferences,
or quirks that might set him apart from the other ThunderCats.
Except he has a little whip thingie. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cheetara</SPAN><BR>
She's telepathic, telekinetic, and telegenic. 
Her main power is to move from place to place so quickly
that she seems to teleport. Impressive, except that the frame rate 
on the ThunderCats is so crappy that pretty much everyone seems
to be jumping from place to place. She just does it with more style.
But at least she <EM>has</EM> style. She's got the best look of
the 'Cats, which isn't saying much considering that her major competitor
is Panthro's "Bondage Meets Tonka" look. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">WilyKat and/or WilyKit</SPAN><BR>
"Thunderkittens." That's what they're called. Kind of an odd
juxtaposition of power and cuddliness, don't you think? Sounds
like something out of a Hallmark creation myth. In my intensive
research, I noticed that WilyK(a|i)t didn't always show up to
Lion-O's little impromptu ass-kicking sessions. Were they
temps? Did they just have better things to do, being fun-loving
free-spirited young'uns? Or perhaps -- I'm just guessing here --
Rankin-Bass didn't want to shell out the cash for the full
voice ensemble to show up for every episode. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Panthro</SPAN><BR>
Um. He fixes things. And he drives the tank. You know, this is
why I've put off covering the Thundercats for so long, in spite of
several requests. They're <EM>not that interesting,</EM> people. 
It's not like I can sit here and say "Well, Panthro's attempts
to reconcile his desire for acceptance with his fear of intimacy
make for a fascinating melange of hope and self-loathing that
all of us have faced in our lives." He <EM>fixes things</EM>!
he <EM>drives the tank</EM>! He's <EM>blue</EM>! Aside from that,
he's just like the rest of them, alternating bland moralism with
soft-core violence. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Snarf</SPAN><BR>
And then we get to the inevitable short annoying sidekick. Snarf
has a personality, in the same sense that tainted pork products
have flavor. My question, though, is this. If the rest of the
team is made up of human-sized, human-shaped cats, and Snarf
is basically cat-sized and cat-shaped, then why isn't Snarf just a
basic cat? Wouldn't that make more sense -- and be substantially
more aesthetically apealling -- than his actual form, which
seems like some sort of god-mocking cross between a cat, a lizard,
and Jerry Garcia. <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.com</SPAN><BR>
This supposedly stands for "commercial," but some of the earliest .coms
I ran into were Santa Cruz geek houses, so obviously people are paying
no more attention to that guideline than to the one that suggests you
only use Q-tips to wash around the outside of your ear. Even now, being
told your .com of choice is unavailable and being offered a .org or .net
instead is like going to the movies and finding out the air conditioning

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.net</SPAN><BR>
As time goes on, the pointlessness of the .net TLD approaches infinity.
By definition, any agency which is applying for a domain name either has
or is attempting to establish an online presence, making this domain something
like having a special pilot's license for those who actually want to go
up in the air. This has become nothing more than a second-choice domain,
so let's say "net" stands for "Nuts! Everything's Taken" and move on. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.org</SPAN><BR>
A TLD with a proud and honorable history, housing such inimitable
sites as <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot.org</A> and <A HREF="http://www.userfriendly.org">userfriendly.org</A>. Both of these recently
stopped being non-profit organizations and are now commercial, though,
underscoring the problems of trying to establish definitions in this
topsy-turvy, helter-skelter, willy-nilly, artsy-fartsy, champaign-urbana,
ralston-purina world. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.edu</SPAN><BR>
At long last, a domain name with some standards! Only four-year accredited
American universities can hook one of these puppies. As much as I appreciate
knowing what to expect, the waste of namespace makes me wonder whether we

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">.gov</SPAN><BR>
If I were a government leader in any country other than the US, I'd

future global hegemony that fundamentalists and eco-terrorists keep going
off about? Or -- and this is my guess -- a reflection of the fact that
you have to punch Americans in the arm just to get them to remember that
other countries exist? <B>D+</B></P>

Same problem as with .gov, only more disturbing. I vote that we fold this

Spock ears may be the driving force behind the Trek phenomenon. Roddenberry
apparently tapped into one of the strongest symbols in the Universal Geek
Unconscious. Somewhere in the back of the mind of every D&amp;D-playing
junior-high-schooler is the equation "pointy ears = cool." Elves, Vulcans,
Yoda, six-breasted Cat Women -- wherever you find dweeby wish-fulfillment,
you find pointy ears. <B>B-</B></P>

Man, they weren't even <EM>trying</EM> with this one. I don't know if they

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Klingon Forehead Ridges</SPAN><BR>
I've heard rumors that the Klingon term for forehead ridges is "flavor curls,"
but I doubt that we're getting confirmation on that one anytime soon. I'm sure 
the Klingons took home the "Most Improved Makeup" award at the Implausible
Aliens Convention, but they never <EM>did</EM> explain how they got to their
present impressive state from the original series, where on the special

<B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Andorian Antennae</SPAN><BR>
Yeah, I realize even acknowledging the existence of Andorian antennae
pegs me as Signori Molti di Geekland, but that's the price you
pay for thoroughness. To my credit, I don't know what purpose the
antennae supposedly serve, but I imagine it had something to do with
natural selection, early in the Andorians' evolution, for lifeforms
that looked completely fakey. This also accounts for the blue skin
and the Caesar-cum-Sno-Balls hairdo. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cardassian Neck Cables</SPAN><BR>
There's something really stylish about the Cardassians with their 
suspension-bridge necks and Trainspotting-meets-Transylvania sunken
eyes, the entire look conspiring to say "I was assembled from an
Erector Set and I may destroy you at any moment." Overall I never really
dug the Cardassians -- the Borg could have assimilated their asses faster 
than you can say "Mr. Tambourine Man" -- but the look was there. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ferengi Teeth</SPAN><BR>
I know the ears and foreheads are supposed to be the attraction here --
how novel for a Star Trek alien -- but I'm always fascinated by the
Ferengi's teeth. All other races in the galaxy seem to have discovered
corrective orthodontia and no-copayment dental plans; the Ferengi
alone dare to keep their teeth looking like Stonehenge on mescaline.
Considering even the warrior-class Klingons must be flossing,
this is an admirable resistance to inter-species peer pressure. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mexican "Dog" Turns Out To Be Hairless Rat</SPAN><BR>
I'll be the first to admit a vague resemblance between
chihuahuas and hairless gutter vermin, but it's a bit
beyond suspension of disbelief to imagine that a ditzy
old woman would actually mistake the latter for the former.
And even if she did, wouldn't one of her friends set her

the sort of thing one politely overlooks in high society,
kind of like a crawling, scaly version of spinach in your teeth? <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">..And On The Door Handle Was a Hook!</SPAN><BR>
Scary, but you'd think that any prospective murderer would
make life easier on himself and open the door with the hand
that can actually grip things. I've never tried opening a
car door with a hook, but one imagines it's something like
trying to remove a bra with a spoon. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Girl Accidentally Breeds Spiders in Hair</SPAN><BR>
A classic urban legend, but one these days it's not much
of a cautionary tale, given that young women rarely wear elaborate
beehives any more. "Spiders in the Sanrio Lunchbox" might be
more appropriate, but it lacks something. Perhaps a paranoid
rumor about the dangers of exposed bellybuttons is in
order. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Your Kidneys May Be Stolen From Your Body</SPAN><BR>
This is a wonderful horror story, replete with nice
improbable touches like waking up naked and
bleeding in a bathtub full of ice: I may never eat
shrimp cocktail again. The special touch, though, is
the humanitarian nature of this legend: it teaches that
we, too, can help those in need, if only by being drugged

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Vanishing Hitchhiker</SPAN><BR>
This lacks a certain something. At least the version in

Spatulas, I'm lead to understand, are the flexible things you use to scrape

Just another one of the little tidbits you can use to "break the ice" at
mass suicides. Everyone likes spatulas, because our first vague memories of
them involve cake batter, back when life was bright and new, before
our souls were embittered by disappointment and utensil-based pedantry. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Egg Beaters</SPAN><BR>
I'm speaking here of the classic hand-turned egg beater. I've always loved
these, because they seemed like they were capable of so
much more than stiffening egg whites. Sometimes I would just sit and
spin the things in the air, watching them rotate into overlapping elliptical
blurs. I'm not sure what I was expecting to happen, but I think it involves
either space flight or time travel.  <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Ice Cream Scoop</SPAN><BR>
Some day someone's going to invent for me a refrigerator with a special
compartment for ice cream that keeps it at the precise temperature between
melting and impenetrable. Until that day, ice cream scoops are both
indispensable and useless. I've never met the scoop that can take on a
stone-solid block of store-brand rocky road. Their only real virtue is that
they keep me from bending all my spoons in half like some demented
Dairy Geller.   <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Egg Slicers</SPAN><BR>
Nearly everyone has one of these little beauties in their utensil drawer,
and yet I've never been served sliced eggs in someone else's home.
Devilled, scrambled, hard-boiled and decorated with bunny stickers, sure.
But not sliced. I'd love to fuel my paranoid fantasies and imagine that all my
friends just think I'm not good enough  for sliced eggs, but I never use
mine either. So I think it's just that we don't eat many salads. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Melon Ballers</SPAN><BR>
The term "melon baller" is precisely the sort of thing that sends
seventh-graders into peals -- or perhaps paroxysms -- of laughter.
In hopes that any easily-amused adolescents reading this will at least
learn the proper names for things, I will instead refer to them as
"breast testiclers." Now, the important thing when making breast
testicles is that they be perfectly round. Nobody likes a lopsided 
testicle in their fruit salad. However, as long as you select a 
high-quality breast testicler -- and a high-quality breast -- you
should be just fine. <B>B</B></P>

Candy named after beans; it's kind of an uncomfortable aesthetic

These often come one flavor to the vending chamber, a flavor
that stays the same through the decades, but which gets a new

These go through three distinct phases as you chew them. First,
there's the initial burst of flavor and sugar, providing incentive
to your brain and quick energy to your jaw muscles. Secondly, there's
the point when you realize that there's really only so much artificial
fruit flavor you want seeping down your throat at one go. Thirdly,

they always seem to be firmly behind the times by about a year in what
they consider to be the "hip thing for kids." The Tamas didn't make
it in until the market was flooded for digital pets, before that

puckered lips, steam coming out of the ears, a mushroom cloud

<p class="ratingheader">Rub Something On It Then Bury it</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The most popular folk remedy for warts seems to be to rub something unpleasant
and organic on it, then bury the unpleasant organic thing to rot. The wart is expected to do its part and rot along with the unpleasant organic thing.
Typical UOTs include stolen meat, a dirty washrag, or
a detached rooster comb. <em>A detached rooster comb.</em> I've never had to consider the prospect of a rooster comb outside of the context of a rooster, and I'm not happy with having to start now. These cures work on the principle of "sympathetic magic," which is where you do something so disagreeable that even if you aren't cured, at least anyone who hears about it will be sympathetic. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Rub Something On It Then Let Someone Else Find it</p>
<p class="ratingbody">What this lacks in detached rooster combs, it makes up for in lack of 
consideration for other people. The principle here is that there are always going to be a certain
number of warts in the world. You can't actually hope to get rid of them
permanently, you can only make it so that you don't have to deal with them
in your own personal life. Just like boy bands. So to remove a wart, you rub it
with something like corn or pebbles or a coin, then leave the item for
someone else to find. Whichever hapless bypasser finds the item gets stuck with
your wart. I've never tried it with boy bands, but the idea of rubbing a pop star with a kernel of corn is oddly soothing. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Freezing<p>
<p class="ratingbody">And now: science! One promising method for removing warts is to <em>blast them
with ultra-cold liquid nitrogen</em> until the <em>flesh is dead</em>. Then you admire
your scar and hope the wart stays gone. Sometimes you need follow-up flesh mortification.
It's interesting how a lot of modern medical techniques make leeching seem
relatively relaxing. On the other hand, modern beauty treatments can make
leeching seem like eating a nice slice of homemade pie while sitting on the front porch listening to the whippoorwills sing. Wart removal is both a medical
treatment AND a beauty treatment, so it's only appropriate that it use techniques that sound like interrogation methods from Babylon 5 novels. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Salicylic Acid</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Nasty, nasty stuff. Burns on contact. Turns skin a chalky white color even
as it kills. You may have heard that aspirin is acetyl salicylic acid. Trust
me, that "acetyl" makes a big difference. I've rubbed aspirin on various parts of my body for reasons that are none of your business, and it never had that
distinct "Hello, my name is <em>corrosive substance</em> and I'll be your
<em>cell-destroying chemical agent</em> this evening" sting to it. Salicylic
acid, I'm told, is effective. It damn well ought to be. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Aloe</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Aloe was the hemp of the late seventies. Pretty much everything from clinical
depression to sudden high-velocity decapitation was expected to be cured by
a simple squeeze of your home-grown aloe plant. It was also used in smoothies,
moisturizers, and no doubt sexual lubricants. Aloe-mania never truly went away,
and some people still treat warts by gently applying the cool, smooth juices
of the aloe plant. I have to admit a preference for something violently medical. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Slip Out The Back, Jack</SPAN><BR>
I'm not entirely clear on the point of slipping out the back, as
opposed to the front. Am I supposed to be afraid of the neighbors seeing
me breaking up? Is the front door guarded by relationship-preserving
rottweilers? Am I supposed to soften the blow by taking out the garbage?
I suppose the furtiveness might appeal to those with an overactive sense
of drama, but I say slip out whatever makes you comfortable. <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Make a New Plan, Stan</SPAN><BR>
I assume the old plan is "Don't leave my lover." Unless the old plan
is "Slip out the back, Jack," in which case Paul Simon really needs
to make up his mind. In either case a new plan is a good idea,
but it's not really a way to leave your lover, is it? New plans
are nice and all, especially when bound attractively, but at the
end of the day you're still sharing a toothpaste tube. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">No Need To Be Coy, Roy, Just Listen To Me</SPAN><BR>
At this point we seem to have abandoned all pretense of actual
lover-leaving in favor of vague personality-building advice.
This is seeming less like useful information and more like
an infomercial for an expensive partner-abandonment seminar. "Just
three payments of fifty-nine ninety-five, Clive." <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Hop On The Bus, Gus</SPAN><BR>
Finally we're getting back to an actual way to leave your lover. Not a
good way, but a way nonetheless. The problem with the bus is that you
generally have to wait around a while before hopping on it, which give
you time to rethink things and your lover time to track you down like
a jilted bloodhound.  I'm not sure whether "Don't need to discuss much"
is an addendum to this piece of advice or a preface to the next one,
so I'm ignoring it. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Just Drop Off the Key, Lee</SPAN><BR>
Now, you see, this is thoughtful. It's a wonderful way to say "The way
you sound like a toy duck when you sneeze has driven me away, but that
doesn't mean I don't care." Then, when your lover writes a tell-all
autobiography, your chapter will be entitled "The Traitorous Deceiving
Asshole" rather than "The Heartless Traitorous Deceiving Asshole." <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Garter</SPAN><BR>
It's far too rare in this society that you find religious
covenants in conjunction with the throwing of undergarments.
Unless you're a Unitarian. The idea here is that whoever catches
the garter is supposed to be the next guy to get married, but 
I'd say that having the most will and determination to snatch women's
clothing out of the air is a good sign that you shouldn't give up
sowing those wild oats just yet. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Shoving of the Cake</SPAN><BR>
What's a lifelong commitment without a bit of slapstick?
While we're at it, why not have the flower girl throw banana peels,
hand the reception line cream pies to throw, and have the person
performing the ceremony refer to the bridal couple as "youse guys"? <B>D</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Part Where You Speak Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace</SPAN><BR>
It's very thoughtful of early wedding arrangers to provide a handy
moment of suspense for Hollywood to take advantage of. In dramas,
this is where the tragic lover reveals her true feelings, in comedies
this is where the wacky mother-in-law to be delights the audience with
a sassy outburst, and in science fiction...well, I can't remember
any notable science fiction movie weddings, but there's room for
something really great there. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Best Man</SPAN><BR>
Hey, any excuse to wear a tuxedo. Actually, these days it's about
the <EM>only</EM> post-prom excuse to wear a tuxedo, unless you
count being a British Secret Service agent at the Baccarat table.
Plus you get to make a toast, which is fun as long as you don't
screw up and call the groom beautiful and the bride lucky. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue</SPAN><BR>
Like a bride doesn't have enough to worry about without making sure her
outfit rhymes. Handy wedding tip: assuming your gown itself
is new, if you can borrow someone's old blue underwear and hit all
the bases without endangering the wedding album. There used to
be a bit on the end about "a silver sixpence in her shoe," but
it's a good thing it died out in this country at least, because
"Bicentennial Quarter" lacks panache. <B>C</B></P>

<B>Charlie</B><BR>
Charlie's okay in a sort of Neo-Dickensian pathetic blond boy way.
It's his Grampa Joe that bugs me. You'd think that if he could 
drag his geriatric ass out of bed to go visit a damned candy factory,
he could have, at some point, gotten up and gotten a job instead of
letting Charlie's mom change his bedpans and make him cabbage
soup for twenty years. But no, he just sits there soaking up her
largesse, and when there's something he <EM>wants</EM> to do, 
suddenly it's miracle time. But that's not Charlie's fault. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Augustus Gloop</SPAN><BR>
You'd think the Oompa-Loompas would be more charitable toward
Augustus, given that their entire livelihood depends on people
like him tossing back empty calories. But then again the Loompas 
seem to lack perspective throughout: they keep saying that if
you follow their little moral ditties then you'll be happy like
them, which sounds pretty good until you realize they're a bunch
of orange midgets in a labor camp. Makes a weakness for bratwurst
sounds pretty healthy in comparison. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Mike Teevee</SPAN><BR>
This kid's supposed to be a hellion, but these days he seems
quaint. I mean, he watches <EM>westerns</EM>. If he was around
these days he'd be playing Redneck Rampage with the Extra Carnage
Pack and living for the ladder on Heat.Net, so a few hours a day with
Roy Rogers seems charming. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Veruca Salt</SPAN><BR>
We have a conundrum here. Veruca is a thoroughly repulsive
pre-teen, repugnant from frame one. Every word out of her
mouth makes you want to slap her so hard your palm print
will still be visible in her first driver's license photo, and
her eventual comeuppance is a physical relief. Okay, fine, but
she's <EM>supposed</EM> to be a bitch princess, so does
she get a high score or a low one? I'm going to put characterization
over personality and give her an <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Violet Beauregarde</SPAN><BR>
Violet rocks. She's got great lines from "Stop squawking, you twit" to 
"What is this, a freak-out?" She knows what she's into -- gum -- and
she excels at it. Sure, her personality wasn't exactly exploding with
social graces, but considering her car salesman father and the dinks
around her, that was understandable. I kept hoping she'd completely
lose it and kick Veruca's ass from white to bittersweet and back again.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Great Pyramid of Giza</SPAN><BR>
The Great Pyramid is nice among world wonders because you can take
poorly-focused pictures of it to this day. I've heard many theories
as to why the pyramids have lasted so long, not all of them involving
aliens from Rigel, but my favorite is "Hey, it's a pyramid. Even a
worn and collapsed pyramid is still basically pyramid-shaped." Anyhow,
due to its geometric simplicity, its hugeful hugeness, and its
original creamy dead-Pharaoh center, the Pyramid rocks among Wonders. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</SPAN><BR>
This is one of the most well-known Wonders, no doubt in part because
the name makes no sense. Hanging? As it turns out, the Hanging
Gardens were essentially the world's first and largest Chia Pet.
King Nebuchadnezzar (rhymes with "Zebuchadnezzar") II built a
ziggurat with built-in planters for his wife, who came from Media
and didn't enjoy Babylon's flat landscape, hot climate, lack of
vegetation, and ugly strip malls with musty laundromats every
hundred yards. So KNII built the Hanging Gardens, which probably
didn't actually exist. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Statue of Zeus at Olympia</SPAN><BR>
This was pretty much what you'd expect: a big ol' statue of the Head
Honcho of the Hellenic Hierarchy, taking up space in a typically 
sparse Greek temple. So much space, in fact, that if the statue came
to life and stood up -- which would be cool -- it would have to stoop
over or smack his polished marble headbone on the roof of
his very own temple. You can hardly blame the sculptor for not
considering the possible effects of extradimensional radiation, but
it's still an odd thought. <B>B-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</SPAN><BR>
Perhaps this should be the fourth through sixth wonders of the world,
as it was destroyed and rebuilt twice before being destroyed for good
in AD 401. The first time it was burned down. I'm not sure how that
works with a stone temple. I assume it involved lots of starter fluid.
Interesting mythological note: The Ephesian Artemis was often portrayed
with several breasts, to signify her awe-inspiring fertility. Weird. Eerie. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</SPAN><BR>
Not just <EM>a</EM> mausoleum, bo-ya, this is <EM>the</EM> Mausoleum,
built for Mausollos of Caria, a king who is best known for being
dead. Like Pharaoh Khufu, Mausollos decided that having a nifty tomb
would make him seem more important than other ex-people. Not content
with a Praying Hands sculpture, he had a resting place built to order.
It wasn't as big or as durable as the Great Pyramid, but it was renowned
for its beauty, although from recreations it looks kind of like the
whipped-cream-topped tiramisu of the dead.  <B>C</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Colossus of Rhodes</SPAN><BR>
Gird yourself for disappointment, if you're the girding type. The
Colossus of Rhodes did not actually span the harbor's entrance in
a crotch-exposing manner. It just stood nearby nakedly. You can
get much the same effect from visiting the Statue of Liberty, which
was designed to be very similar to it, except female, clothed, and
much more appropriate for action films involving helicopters. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Lighthouse of Alexandria</SPAN><BR>
Well, it's a lighthouse. It's nice that one of the ancient wonders
did something besides astonish historians and keep vultures from
getting at the bodies of kings, but there's a certain sweeping
poetry lacking in such a utilitarian wonder. More interesting
is the legend that the great mirror in the lighthouse could be
used to light ships afire like an evil science project, but
if you believe that I've got a slightly used temple to sell you. <B>D+</B></P>
