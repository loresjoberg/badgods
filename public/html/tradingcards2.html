It cracks me up that <cite>Growing Pains</cite> had fans who would run out and buy
merchandise. <cite>Family Ties</cite>, sure.  <cite>The Cosby Show</cite>, maybe. But <cite>Growing
Pains</cite>? I'd sooner buy a <cite>Thicke of the Night</cite> lunchbox than one with the
<cite>Growing Pains</cite> gang on it.  Anyhow the cards depict various forgettable,
imitable, and comparable moments from the series, including something
involving a cake, something involving a table, and lots and lots of puffy
hair. If you ever get thrown out of a plane, aim for the heads of the
cast of <cite>Growing Pains</cite>. Their bouffs and dos will cushion your landing so
well, you'll think you're being put gently to bed by your beloved nanny. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

Simply pathetic. Just about as lame as a trading card can be short of
writing "Yastrzemski" on a torn cardboard box lid with a Sharpie. The ostensible Rad Dudes depicted
are not consistently either rad or dudes. While "Boogie Boardin' Bob" 
is both a dude and marginally rad, "Nerdy Nathan" is not rad, and
"Awesome Volleyball Val" is not a dude. I'd say that radness and dudeness
intersect on only three of the cards I got. That is not acceptable percentage
of the US RDA. Next stupidness: the art is lame. Next stupidness: the quotes
on the back are completely devoid of humor. If laughter is found to
cause cancer, these cards will be hailed as a medical miracle. Final
sudden-death stupidness bonus round: out of ten cards, <em>four</em>
are repeats. So now I have two "Busted Bens" and it makes me surly. <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>

Christ, I thought the gay rock icon cards had lots of bare chests. I had
no idea how much time the members of Menudo spent swimming. On the other
hand, if I had to wear matching polo shirts from Dork Brothers Clothiers
I'd take any chance to strip down to my shorts as well. The backs are
written in both English and Spanish, so culture is no barrier to
learning that Charlie is a Gemini. In an amazing act of non-prescience,
one of the cards explains that Ricky Martin is destined to be a future
comedian. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

I inspected the enclosed iron-on for any signs of arousal or tumescence
and came up empty-handed. As it were. So already I've been deceived. At
this rate I'll never again trust printed wax paper. The single tiny
iron-on included is a picture of a dirt bike with the word "HODAKA,"
which I now understand is a brand of Taiwanese motorcycle. Instructive,
yet boring.  If there are any Hodaka fans who would like a 70s-era iron-on
of your favorite bike brand, I'd be happy to give you this for free. The
catch is, you have to eat the gum. <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

Three cards, three stickers, and one piece of wrapped, clearly-labelled
Bazooka chewing gum. It's somehow blasphemous to have wrapped gum in
a trading card packet. I thought it was a federal law that they had to
contain one piece of naked pink rectangular gum with all the physical
properties of drywall except that the flavor only lasts half as long.
As for
the cards: spiky hair, dewy eyes, and a surprising lack of photos of drum
machines. I'm disappointed that they didn't include scratch-and-sniff
stickers, because I for one would like to know what the hell a sound
smells like. <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>
