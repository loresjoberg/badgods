<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Compasses</SPAN><BR>
A compass, when you think about it, is essentially a very primitive
Spirograph. A very primitive, very very boring Spirograph. And Spirographs
themselves aren't exactly a blowjob in Times Square either. I spent
many hours as a kid Spirographing before I realized with depressing
horror that Spirographs are essentially flat Slinkies that don't move.
But this isn't <EM>about</EM> me! This is about compasses, which aren't
really that interesting outside of geometry class, unless you're really
particular about the quality of the peace signs and/or anarchy symbols
you draw in your notebook. <B>C-</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Pencil Sharpeners</SPAN><BR>
I don't see why people are so worried about asbestos in schools when there
is the accumulated detrius of thousands of pencil sharpenings staining every
nook, cranny, and carved initial in every desk in every school in every
country where standardized tests are given. Inhaling all that has got
to give you cysts or something. Anyhow, I'd like pencil sharpeners
better if there were more quality control ensuring that you don't end
up with a wooden peak with some graphite on its north face. <B>C</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Protractors</SPAN><BR>
Possibly the least exciting school supply on the planet. I'm certain that
somewhere out there some school supply company or another is trying to
inject verve and fasion into protractors, and I'm equally certain they're
failing. The day they invent something else that can protract, I'm all
over it. <B>D</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Glue Sticks</SPAN><BR>
I like glue sticks. They're sensible fun. Those little pastepot dipper sticks 
that were attached to the lid were always vaguely incomprehensible to me.
Twenty years later and I still kind of find them baffling. But glue sticks,
man, they're the easiest thing in the world. Turn the knob and you're easing
down Glue Street on a sunny day! <B>A</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Roundy Scissors</SPAN><BR>
Yes, they're safer, but do they really prepare our children for life? The
real world has a lot of pointy scissors, bunky. A child who's
grown up on a fantasy island of rounded cutting implements is going
to be in for a harsh lesson when it's time to enter reality. A harsh,
pointed, gouging lesson that leaves a mark. <B>B-</B></P></TD>
