Not nearly as interesting as they sound. You put a small colorful capsule
that's just begging to be ingested by an impulsive first-grader into
a glass of hot water, and at some point -- once you're good and bored -- it
turns into a small foam outline that, at least half the time, resembles
a dinosaur and not the little bits of foam that you'd expect to be left
over <EM>after</EM> you made a little foam outline of a dinosaur.  You get
eighteen little capsules of asphyxiatingly tedious dinosaur action. <B>D</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Secret Puzzle</SPAN><BR>
This unlink-the-metal-pieces game promises "Hours of Fun." This is such
a lie that I am concerned that the package designer's pants may be on fire
<EM>even now</EM>. A linked-metal puzzle cannot provide hours of fun. It
can provide minutes of fun or hours of frustration. This provided
about a minute and a half of vague distraction. I am not trying to
play up my own prowess when I tell you that I've had fast food orders that
took longer to sort out than this puzzle. If you find this game
fascinating, I know a great game you can play that requires nothing
more than both hands and a flashlight. <B>D</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Stormy Weather Rain Bonnets</SPAN><BR>
I didn't catch the plural when I bought this; I expected to get only
the one rain bonnet. I'm impressed that they managed to fit five rain
bonnets into a package about the size of a skimpy chimichanga. The bonnets
themselves are less impressive, though. Looking at one out of context, you
would not guess that it was supposed to be a bonnet. You'd probably guess
that it was an important part used in making transparent kangaroos. I
really think you would. It is, in keeping with the Mexican food theme,
sort of a plastic head taco. You stick your head in the plastic taco,
and the rest of you gets wet. But you get five of them. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Boomerang Party Favors</SPAN><BR>
You really only expect one thing from a boomerang. If you throw it
and it ends up more or less where it started, it's a good boomerang.
It doesn't even have to whistle, glow, or cut off fingers like in <CITE>The
Road Warrior</CITE>. These are not good boomerangs. They are tragic little
pieces of plastic that will make small children cry. <B>D-</B></P></TD>

<TD><P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Fishing Net</SPAN><BR>
I'm going to assume, for my sanity and yours, that nobody is 
buying cheap little fishing nets at the dollar store with the intention
of actually catching fish. Of course that leaves relatively few uses
for miniature fishing nets, but the main two -- decorating seafood
restaurants and providing challenges for your action figures -- are
so noble that I'm left with vague approval for this twine tchotchke. <B>B-</B></P></TD>

I'm not sure to whom the "my" in this thing's name refers. It's certainly
not <EM>my</EM> favorite diary, my favorite diary is Ana&iuml;s Nin's. This
one does have impressionist penguins on the front, though, which is the
one thing that Ana&iuml;s can't provide. It also has a little lock on it,
which is very cute but which I was able to pick in about thirty seconds
using an eyeglass screwdriver. What can I say, it's my night for pulling
metal things apart. <B>B+</B></P></TD>
