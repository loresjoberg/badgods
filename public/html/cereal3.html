<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">USA Olympic Crunch</SPAN><BR>
An ill-considered bit of breakfast jingoism, as
evidenced by the fact that, as far as I can tell,
it was only available in wholesale stores. 
USA Olympic Crunch (so named, I assume,
to distinguish it from Canada Olympic Crunch) is
just Lucky Charms with different shapes and about
one-tenth the marshmallows. Now if they had decided
to increase the number of marshmallows, perhaps
inverting the cereal-marshmallow ratio, then at least
it would have been a bold experiment. As-is, Patriotic
Sports Puffs are not my idea of a breakfasty good time.

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Froot Loops</SPAN><BR>
One of the nicest things that ever happened to me
was when a then-girlfriend took it upon herself
to go through a box of Froot Loops and separate the
colors. She then gave the box, each color in
an individual baggie, to me. What wonders I did to deserve
segregated fruit cereal, I don't know, but I experienced
a thrill not unlike opening the fabled Ark of the Covenant,
except without the melting face bit. At any rate,
I was able to answer the Eternal Froot Loop question:
Do the different colors <EM>really</EM> taste different?
The long-awaited answer: Sort of. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Frosted Flakes</SPAN><BR>
Cereal, sugar, box, disturbing cartoon animal, worthless premium:
Frosted Flakes embodies everything it means to be sugary breakfast
cereal. In a world where new breakfast cereals rise up, shine
briefly, and are struck down by what Adam Smith called "The invisible
blood-encrusted two-by-four of the market," Frosted Flakes abide.
I do want to pick one nit, though: if you were playing basketball
with a skinny loser of a kid and a 6' 4" cartoon tiger with biceps
the size of the giant turtle at the petting zoo, and you got your ass
kicked, would you then be saying "Whoa! That kid's good!" or would
you instead be saying "We'd be doing pretty good too, if we had
a <EM>giant anthropomorphic jungle cat</EM> on our side!" <B>A-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Rice Krispies Treats</SPAN><BR>
They taste better in milk than Chex Mix does, I'll give them
that. And come to think of it, actual Rice Krispies treats make
at least as much sense as part of this nutritious breakfast as
Pop Tarts do. But Rice Krispies Treats Cereal doesn't taste
like Rice Krispies Treats. It tastes, in a word, awful. Marshmallows
don't have the most natural flavor ever to wander down the gullet,
but whatever marshmallow substitute they devised to hold the
amphibian-egg-sac-like clusters of Krispies together is to marshmallows
as marshmallows are to fresh organic island-grown sugar cane. <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch</SPAN><BR>
Weird. Eerie. Peanut buttery. The thing about Peanut Butter
Captain Crunch is that I don't really like it, except when
I'm eating it. When I'm eating it, I compulsively wolf down
the entire box at one sitting, then I go back to not liking it.
It's like some early-morning Jekyll-and-Hyde routine. Here's
an idea for a commercial for Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch:
They have characters that want to steal the cereal, characters that want to protect the
cereal, characters that are afraid the cereal will make them lose
their minds; why not a character who doesn't like the cereal until
some rosy-cheeked and trendily-dressed grade-schoolers shove it down
his throat, at which point the character grabs the entire box
and kicks and beats the children away while he chorfs down.
Anyhow, I'm going to assume my cereal-eating id is correct here 
and give this an <B>A-</B>.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Cocoa & Fruity Pebbles</SPAN><BR>
This cereal has problems. First off, it's about the only cereal
that doesn't stay crunchy in milk. It gets soggy in milk, and does
so in a hurry. I've learned, over the years, to severely limit 
the amount of milk I add to Pebbles, lest I be
forced to eat what would be more accurately called "Flaccid
Rice Ovals." Secondly, they have the most God-awful commercials
imaginable. I get enough of the trend of the week without seeing
Barney in a trend-of-the-week costume. <B>C-</B></P>
