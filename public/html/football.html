<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Magic Pencils</SPAN><BR>
My favorite part of the game is when the announcers make
all these circles and lines on the screen the better to illustrate
their subtle and intricate point that the two teams are attempting
to move in opposite directions. My big thought this week is that all
TVs should come with built-in magic pencil attachments, to that
you can provide your own running commentary on TV shows. "Okay,
Jerry [draws a circle] is going to try for the mouse hole
[draws an arrow] in hopes that Tom, [circle] chasing him at
full speed [arrow] will run straight into the wall [stars and asterisks], 
causing his head to become comically flat." <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Beer Commercials</SPAN><BR> 
You'll notice that beer commercials --
those not featuring lizards and bikini girls -- often show the whirling
rapids and golden fields of barley that supply ingredients for their
watery swill, but they never show the hops, even when they talk about
them. Do you know why? Because hops are <EM>flowers.</EM> The advertisers
know that if the Joe Six-Packs and Ed Pony-Kegs of the nation
find out that their beloved man-brew is made out of 
millions of tiny, delicate dried flowers, there's going to be a 
massive migration to bourbon. <B>D+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Referees</SPAN><BR>
These guys have my respect. There they are, normal
guys in their stripey pajamas, surrounded by charging
hulks with muscles the size of prizewinning melons,
communicating through the magic of interpretive dance.
It's one thing to run with the bulls at Pamplona; it's
another thing entirely to call a fifteen-yard penalty on the
bulls at Pamplona for unsportsmanlike conduct and live
to tell about it. <B>B+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Guys Who Paint Themselves</SPAN><BR>
This has actually been adequately judged in a recent
<A HREF="/toys/goodorbad5.html">Good or Bad</A>, but I just
wanted to add it here to point out that all the people who
go to Burning Man to run around covered
in paint as some sort of primal tribute to the tribal
nature of humanity obviously got the idea from
football. That's right, <EM>football!</EM> Replace 
"combustible effigy" with "halftime show" and you've got
a <EM>mainstream sporting event!</EM> Take that, hipsters! <B>D-</B></P>


<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Actual Football</SPAN><BR>
Whatever. <B>C-</B></P>
