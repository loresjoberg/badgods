<p class="ratingheader">Candles</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Little colorful candles, clearly enough, are the canonical birthday cake
topper. So much so, in fact, that any food you put them in automatically
becomes a birthday food. Candles in a fruit torte? Birthday torte!
Candles in a potato-leek quiche? Birthday quiche! Candles in the 
partially-decomposed body of a hobo who died of exposure and heart
disease? Birthday hobo! And remember, blow out every candle on the
hobo or you don't get your wish! <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Numbers</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Technically these are candles too, but I think of them more as flaming
cop-outs. Call me a traditionalist, but I want to see a number of
candles equal to the age of the birthday person in question, no matter
that it results in a thick layer of pastel wax. Barring that, I'm
willing to cope with a single symbolic candles, or a row of white and
blue candles indicating binary numbers. I'm flexible that way. But
a big melting pair of digits? If you're over twenty, it's kind of lame.
If you're under fourteen it's heartbreaking. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Plastic Figures</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I've always had a mild fascination with the combination of cheapo
plastic figures and roughly-sculpted frosting environments. Pooh gets
to climb around in a frosting tree, dinosaurs roam through artificially
colored whipped underbrush, Batman patrols an incongruously sweet Gotham City.
The oddest to me was always the army men, fighting over a 
patch of baked, sugar-encased disputed territory. So many wars could
be prevented if countries could just agree that one side slices and
the other side gets first choice. <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Frosting Roses</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Frosting flowers almost always seem to be roses. I guess it's because
the little layers of petals are easy to build up, and you don't have to
address the difficult issue of what a frosting stamen would look like.
I have no beef with frosting roses. They seem like a reasonable way
to make a cake look festive, and you don't have to pick them out of your
teeth like real roses. My one real complaint is my general disappointment
whenever something sugary is colorful, but not properly flavored. If
the roses are pink, they should be strawberry flavored. Or possibly
bubble gum. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Rice Paper Printout of Someone's Face</p>
<p class="ratingbody">This is just sad. It takes all the thrill out of the experience of seeing
a well-decorated cake when you just pulled the birthday person's face
out of a printer. I know that digital imaging exists. It doesn't impress me.
You could just hand me a piece of cake and a Polaroid and the
effect would be the same. I guess what I'm saying here is that while
sometimes I feel that my life lacks ritual, the ceremonial eating of
my friends' faces doesn't seem like the most comfortable way of filling
that gap. <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>
