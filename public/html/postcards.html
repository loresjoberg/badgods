This card features a completely nude Gena Lee Nolin with a bad case of
mermaid hair. Now me, I'd consider a primordial rainforest to be
a great place to put clothes on, what with the insects and the jaguar
scratches and the fish that swim up your urethra. And I'm guessing, just
guessing here, that Nolin puts some sort of savage ensemble together for
the actual show, but here on the postcard she resembles the jaybird in
her nudity. Now <em>that's</em> pandering. <B>D</B></P></TD>

This is intended, I think, to portray the mouth of some sort of
dairy elemental, grinning with delight at the taste of the featured
candy. However, there is an undeniable vaginal connotation to the artwork,
and I don't think it was a complete accident. While normally a staunch
ally of the vagina, in the case of milk-sculpted, candy-slurping postcard
vaginas I have to admit to being creeped the holy hell out. <B>D-</B></P></TD>

The top half of this card is taken up with a college-dorm painting
of three ladies -- each with a different hair color, following
the Apartment 3-G Rule -- enjoying a pizza and not actually facing 
each other. The whole thing is very heartwarming until you realize
they're probably just watching TV. Anyhow, there's a recipe below
for, I assume, the very pizza they're eating, complete with suggested
brand names in all-caps ("1 pkg. ATHENOS Traditional Crumbled Feta Cheese with
Basil & Tomato"). At least it's informative. <B>B-</B></P></TD>

This card follows in the fine Los Angeles advertising tradition of not
telling you what the hell they're advertising. Presumably, looking at this
card, I will be compelled to invest in jeans, or boots, or possibly concrete.
Only the tiny words "A Kenneth Cole Production" provide a clue as to
what product I'm intended to covet. Well, they <em>are</em> nice boots. <B>D+</B></P></TD>

Apparently this has something to do with a book called "The Sisterhood of
the Traveling Pants" which I have to admit is a catchy title. Pretty much
anything with "pants" in it gets my attention, it's sad. Anyhow, the
first rule of the SotTP is "You must never wash the pants." I thought
this was some sort of female bonding sentimental thing, but according
to the Web site the eighth rule involves spanking so now I'm not so sure. <B>C</B></P></TD>
