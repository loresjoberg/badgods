This doesn't seem very good. Unless the owner is thoughtful enough
to erase the symbol on his way back in, this is about as useful as a
symbol meaning "it's six-thirty." I suppose you could carefully inscribe
it somewhere where it's going to get concealed whenever the ower gets
home, maybe by putting it in his driveway or writing it in dust on the
welcome mat, then spreading some dirt around the walkway so that the
owner wipes his feet when he comes home. But that doesn't seem like the
sort of things that hobos do. When you're playing word association,
"hobo" is rarely followed by "elaborate plan." <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Crime Committed Here</p>

I find this one strangely chilling. If I'm ever walking down a dirt road
and I see the "crime committed here" sign, I'm definitely getting the
heebies, and I'm seriously considering the jeebies. I think it's the
vagueness.  The crime could be littering or telemarketing to someone on
the Do Not Call list, but the fact that it doesn't specify makes it seem
like it must refer to some crime too terrible to mention.  One involving
severed heads, bloody manacles, or both. When you think about it, though,
vandalism and grafitti are crimes, making this the only self-fulfilling
hobo sign. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">A Man With a Gun Lives Here</p>
<p class="ratingbody">
<img src="/ls-content/images/hobosign-manwithgun.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left">
You'd think the symbol for "man with gun" would have something at least
vaguely resembling a man or a gun. This looks more like the symbol for
"moose in a tent." Not only is it anti-intuitive, it means you're at a
loss if you ever want to warn people about a tent with a moose in it.
My other complaint is that if I were a hobo I'd want the symbol for
"man with a gun" to be something very simple, preferably something you
could scrawl across a fencepost while running like a startled springbok. <span class="ratinggrade">D+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Tell a Pitiful Story</p>

Apparently soft-hearted widows don't go in for variety. You'd think
after the fifteenth hard luck story the potential sandwich donor would
want to hear something upbeat, perhaps a humorous story involving baby
ducks and an unusual hat such as a derby or fireman's helmet. But no,
thanks to "Hobo Bill" VanDerScratchy and his "pitiful story" symbol,
she has to listen to yet another tale of starving children and a devoted
mother succumbing to diptheria. Can't you at least put spacemen in it
or something? <span class="ratinggrade">C</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Free Telephone</p>

My brain gets in surly, personal arguments with itself over which to
boggle over first, the fact that a hobo would have need of a telephone,
or that the symbol for such would be a plover. I can't imagine the hobo
lifestyle has a lot of advantages, but right at the top has to be "lack
of dependency on telecommunications." If they ever develop a hobo symbol
for "owner has a PS2 with the online adapter and will let you get in
a quick game of Madden," I'm going to be very sad. Even moreso if it's
some sort of shorebird. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>
