<p class="ratingheader">No Cum Dodging Allowed</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Mostly I just want to see the sign for this one. Clearly, in
an international sport like bukkake, there have to be pictorial
symbols to indicate when cum dodging is allowed, not allowed,
and encouraged. Now that I think of it, when is it ever allowed?
Is there some whole semen-evasion subgenre that I haven't
been informed of? At any rate, any title that spells the word
come as "cum" gets marked down a whole letter grade, so: <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Space Invaderz</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm totally unclear on the significance of the "z" in "Space Invaderz."
I thought I understood z-plurals: they indicate something which is
both youth-oriented and extreme. So, while "tea cozies" are something
cherished by old ladies wearing shawls, "tea coziez" are all the rage
among adrenalin-infused, rapping, snowboarding youth who may or may not be
wearing "shawlz." So why is this called "Space Invaderz"? Is the "z"
in this context intended to indicate "in a body orifice, most
likely the butt"? Just when I think I have the alphabet figured. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Gangbang Auditions #7</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Uh. It seems to me that once you've gotten seven installments in
a series, you can't really pretend it's an audition anymore. How
would you distinguish it from an <em>actual</em> gangbang, anyway?
It seems to me that if there is a gang, and there is banging, then
there's no "audition" about it. Do they say "Do Greg here,
but pretend he's eight guys"? I don't think that's going to lead
to an accurate assessment of someone's actual gangbang skill set.
Even more of a conundrum is the question of whether they held
auditions for "Gangbang Auditions #7," and if they did, what they
called the resulting video. This could lead to "Gangbang Audition
Tryout Demonstration Screening Tests #72." <span class="ratinggrade">C-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">It's Raining Tushy Girls</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The mind staggers. I try to picture what it would mean to be
in the middle of a pleasant summer rain of tushy girls, or perhaps
a tempestuous deep-winter tushy girl storm. Maybe you're the
captain of a schooner, rounding the horn, and the first mate
bursts into your cabin, eyes wild with fear. "Cap'n!" he says.
"It's raining tushy girls!" But my brain just rejects
it, perhaps because I'm not sure what a "tushy girl" is. I think
it involves butt dimples. At any rate, I'm pretty sure this is
what Charles Fort masturbated to. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Rocco: Animal Trainer</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Man, I can think of about six things this could be, none of them
appetizing. A best-case scenario is that it's some sort of porn
version of Steve Irwin's schtick, with some long-schlonged 
ex-bodybuilder gamely attempting an Australian accent while
surrounded by...women dressed up as crocodiles and dingos, I guess.
I <em>hope</em>, because all the other options are even more
distasteful. I never thought I'd reach the point in my life where
I'd be saying, "Boy, I hope this video has women dressed up as
crocodiles and dingos in it." <span class="ratinggrade">D-</span></p>
