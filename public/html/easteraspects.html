<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Colored Eggs</SPAN><BR>
Yeah, sure, garishly pastel hen ova are fun and all, and it's
reasonably diverting to run all over hell and gone looking for
them. But then when you're done, what do you have? Maybe a dozen
hard boiled eggs. Either these have to be eaten -- no small task for
those of us who consider hard-boiled eggs to be just this side of inedible --
or chucked into the trash, which hardly seems to be an appropriate
fertility-rite-cum-resurrection-tribute. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Plastic Grass</SPAN><BR>
I like plastic grass, and I'm not sure why. I also like plastic flowers
and the little plastic leaf thingy you get with grocery-store sushi, so
apparently I'm pretty positive towards all forms of plastic vegetation.
Not as a replacement for regular vegetation, mind you. I enjoy plastic
plants in the same way that I enjoy tribute albums: as an educational,
interesting, and sometimes embarrassingly laughable reinterpretation of
a classic. <B>B</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Chocolate Bunnies</SPAN><BR>
I'm not going to get too baroque here: it's chocolate and it's sculpted.
Nothing to complain about there. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">The Easter Bunny</SPAN><BR>
I think we need to funnel more tax money into holiday pooka research.
Modern science has yet to come to a consensus on many important
Easter Bunny issues: Is he a big human-sized rabbit or a small more-or-less
rabbit-sized rabbit?  Is he white or pink? And, perhaps the question with
the most potential social fallout, does he or does he not lay eggs? These
are important questions, and they're being virtually ignored. Oh, and
what exactly is a "bunny trail"? <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Peeps</SPAN><BR>
Borderline fluorescent edible farm animals are my thing. I don't much care
for the recent rabbit-shaped additions to the Peeps line, but that's
only because they're shaped like greeting-card cartoon rabbits, not actual
pellet-munching mammals. If they managed to make them look like doe-eyed
bunnies hunkered down and awaiting their grisly fate, they'd be much more
fun to eat. <B>A+</B></P>
