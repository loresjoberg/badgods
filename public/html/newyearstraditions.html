<p class="ratingheader">Resolutions</p>
<p class="ratingbody">The interesting thing about New Year's Resolutions is that the flaws
they address are usually most in evidence during the holidays; eating
too much, drinking too much, spending too much money, yelling at your
family, making out with a coworker behind the ficus at an office party,
that sort of thing. It's a handy arrangement--when looking for ways to
shore up your personality, you only have to consider the past three or
four weeks. This also explains why so few New Year's Resolutions involve
sculling, tanning, or sand castles. <span class="ratinggrade">B</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Auld Lang Syne</p>
<p class="ratingbody">It's always funny to hear people sing Scots poetry while wearing
shiny hats. I usually try to get everyone to launch into "<a
href="http://www.robertburns.org/works/333.shtml">Johnie Lad, Cock Up
Your Beaver</a>" to the tune of "Puff the Magic Dragon" as an encore,
but by then everyone's putting on coats and calling babysitters so
it's never really gotten the ensemble treatment it deserves. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Kissing at Midnight</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I'm glad to see that this tradition hasn't gone the route of mistletoe.
You don't have to kiss everyone who asks, or whichever random
partygoer happens to have sidled over to you, you just traditionally
kiss anyone with whom you're in an established or incipient kissing
relationship. Having said that, it's not so much a tradition as "the
obvious thing to do." It's midnight, you've been drinking, and you're
with someone with whom you share a relationship and/or birth control
responsibilities.  What else are you going to do? Shake hands? Notarize
documents? <span class="ratinggrade">B-</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Noisemakers</p>
<p class="ratingbody">Making a lot of noise at midnight is supposed to ward off evil
spirits. Just like partially every other ancient tradition, from saying
"Gesundheit" to watching the Super Bowl for the commercials. It would
have been interesting to live back in historical times where people
apparently felt that evil spirits were ubiquitous, yet excruciatingly
timid. If using a fifty-cent cardboard horn to make a duck noise scares
off evil spirits for an entire year, I figure putting up a small sign
saying "EVIL SPIRITS WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER'S EXPENSE" should keep them
out of my hair for a decade or so. <span class="ratinggrade">C+</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Standing on a Chair and Eating Grapes</p>
<p class="ratingbody">I found this "tradition" mentioned in only one place on the entire
Web. I must admit, however, that I haven't looked very hard. This
is because I want to believe. In my heart I want there to be people,
many thousands of people, who mark the passing of the old year
and the coming of the new by standing on a chair and eating grapes.
I won't be doing it myself, of course, it's way too goofy, but
I'd be very happy to know that other people are doing it. <span class="ratinggrade">A</span></p>

<p class="ratingheader">Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve</p>
<p class="ratingbody">"Rockin'" has become one of those terms that have come to mean
the absence of what they describe, like "extreme" and
"perfectly legal." Anything described as "rockin'"
is nearly guaranteed not to rock. Case in point, there is perhaps
nothing less rockin' to do with your New Year's Eve than to
turn on the television and watch other people having a party.
Particularly if Rod Stewart's on the bill. Rod Stewart was last 
reported rocking in 1988, and even then it was an unreliable witness
with a malfunctioning camera. <span class="ratinggrade">D</span></p>
