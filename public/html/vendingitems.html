Good deal! These suckers do exactly what they're expected
to do: bounce really really high. They also inevitably
get stuck in the rain gutter, but that's okay because they're
only a damn quarter. Plus they come in all sorts of cheery
colors and they have that magic-marker kind of smell that
probably kills off brain cells like ants under a lawnmower. <B>A</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Boston Baked Beans</SPAN><BR>
Candy named after beans; it's kind of an uncomfortable aesthetic
conflict, make even more unnerving by the fact that every handful
of these candy-coated peanuts is a voyage of texture discovery.
Will they be crunchy? Chewy? Squishy? It all depends on how
long they've been languishing in their little transparent prison. <B>C+</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Big-Ass Gumballs</SPAN><BR>
These often come one flavor to the vending chamber, a flavor
that stays the same through the decades, but which gets a new
adjective every few years. (1971: Rockin' Raspberry. 1993: Rad Raspberry.)
These go through three distinct phases as you chew them. First,
there's the initial burst of flavor and sugar, providing incentive
to your brain and quick energy to your jaw muscles. Secondly, there's
the point when you realize that there's really only so much artificial
fruit flavor you want seeping down your throat at one go. Thirdly,
the point becomes moot as the gum abruptly stops giving off flavorants
and acquires the texture of a kneaded eraser. Typically the entire
cycle takes about ninety seconds. <B>C-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Imitation Tamagotchi</SPAN><BR>
Of course, you don't run into a machine full of imitation Tamagotchi.
No, the little placard on the front features the dopey thing prominently,
but they're packed about one to a machine, and you have to wade
through several dollars' worth of plastic insects and plastic lockets
to get to it. The funny thing about these sorts of machines is that
they always seem to be firmly behind the times by about a year in what
they consider to be the "hip thing for kids." The Tamas didn't make
it in until the market was flooded for digital pets, before that
it was troll dolls after that little fad-echo had thankfully faded, and
I remember vending machines with mini-Rubik's Cubes long after Cube
champions couldn't even get on "That's Incredible." <B>D-</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ratingheader">Sour Candy</SPAN><BR>
Sour is in these days, apparently as a sort of
indicator of preteen machismo, which is pretty funny
considering how rarely "badass" and "strawberry flavor" appear
in the same sentence. The placard typically portrays a cartoon
candy consumer in some variety of sour-induced implosion, with
puckered lips, steam coming out of the ears, a mushroom cloud
emerging from an exposed braincase, and so forth. This would all
be very impressive except for the fact that the candy in question
is about on the level of SweetTarts in terms of physical challenge. <B>C</B></P>
