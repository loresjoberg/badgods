<P><BIG><B>Brontosaurus</B></BIG><BR>Huge beast. Ate only 
plants, but could crush a '93 Cabriolet with a single step of 
its titanic brontosaurus feet. Name means "Thunder Lizard" 
which is about as cool as you can get. Its only real drawback 
is that it didn't really exist. <B>B+</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Apatosaurus</B></BIG><BR>This is what they're calling 
brontosauruses these days. Apparently they had some 
problem with the wrong skull on the wrong body--duh--and 
once they figured it out they had to change the name to 
"apatosaurus," which means "Deceptive Lizard." Personally 
I think they should have looked up the Latin for "Stupid 
Scientist." <B>D</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Dimetrodon</B></BIG><BR>Looks like a gecko with a 
mohawk. Big sail on its back that they think attracted mates 
or conserved body heat. Actually, that's what scientists say 
about anything on an animal they don't understand. They 
could find evidence of an iguanadon with a ZZ Top beard 
and they'd say "the beard was probably to conserve body 
heat or attract mates." Which, come to think of it, is 
probably what ZZ Top uses them for. Anyhow,

<P><BIG><B>Tyrannosaurus Rex</B></BIG><BR>
<B>Cool</B> animal. Name means "Tyrant Lizard 
King." Cool. I wish <B>my</B> name meant 
"Tyrant Lizard King." Anyhow, we all know what makes 
this such a great dinosaur--it could completely eat you. Plus 
the little tiny forearms make it look like some demented 
nightmare beast from the fertile mind of Tim Burton.

<P><BIG><B>Velociraptor</B></BIG><BR>These guys got a lot of 
press from "Jurassic Park," but let's face it, they're pretty 
lacking. They couldn't even manage to eat two little kids, 
one of whom had only minutes before been turned into a 
toaster pastry. Sure, they got the hunter, but he was coming 
up with cute last words when he should have been running 
like a bunny. And then all three of them got totally worked 
by a baby Tyrannosaurus! Lame! <B>D!</B></P>
 
<P><BIG><B>Stegosaurus</B></BIG><BR>Two words: spiked tail. 
"Oh, so you're sneaking up behind me to eat my delicious 
body? <STRONG>WHAM!</STRONG> Spikes! For you! In your 
head!" Plus it had I-am-an-industrial-monster plates on its 
back, which while probably for conserving body heat or 
attracting mates, were impressive-looking.
