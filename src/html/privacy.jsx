	PRIVACY POLICY
</p>
<p>
	I collect the standard data that Web browsers provide. This includes your IP address, the file you're requesting, the date and time, your browser name and version, and in some cases the page you came from. I make no guarantees as to what I do with this information, so if you don't want it collected, use a proxy or anonymizer or some other obscuring technique. By and large, there's no way to identify you personally using this information without a subpoena and a certain amount of luck, so personally, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
</p>
<p>
	I may link to graphics or other material from other sites. If I do, those sites will probably also be collecting standard browser data, and I have no control over what they do with it.
</p>
<p>
	All payments are handled through PayPal. Please see their privacy page for their statement. Again, I don't have any control over what they do with the information they get from you. I never see your credit card number. What information they do provide I will use only for payment-related purposes, such as clarifying information or mailing merchandise.
</p>
<p>
	Any mail sent to lore@bookofratings.com or any other bookofratings.com e-mail address may be published, unless you specify that you don't want it published. Your e-mail address will not be published with your mail, but whatever name you provide may be.
