			Okay, they've got the Statue of Liberty, that's a gimme. They also have a picture of the state itself, which is something of a motif among uncreative quarter designers. At least New York has an excuse, though: they need something to convince Buffalo and Syracuse that they're important, too. <b>D+</b>

			North Carolina's coin has a lovely picture of the Wright Brothers catching some air. Take that, Ohio! Actually, thanks to the magic of bas relief, it looks like Wilbur is going to have his tiny head chopped right off, so if you like to make up gruesome stories at bus stops and need inspiration, this coin may be right up your alley. <b>C+</b>

			There's a nice picture of the Pell Bridge, which let's be honest looks like pretty much any other suspension bridge, at least when reduced to pocket change, and a nice sailboat. The mint's blurb explains that Rhode Island's most popular sport is sailing, and I believe that they are lying to me. I figure that sailing is a pretty expensive thing to get into, and I'm betting there are more games of dodge ball, foosball or possibly punch bug going on in Rhode Island than there are sailing events at any given time. It's just a feeling I have. <b>C-</b>

			Hey, it's got a chilly-looking guy collecting maple syrup! There's also some famous-only-to-natives mountain in back, but who cares. If they can't, for legal reasons, put a pint of Chunky Monkey on the quarter, some guy sucking the sap out of trees for my breakfast pleasure is a good second choice. <b>B+</b>

			The Kentucky quarter has an old Kentucky home and the words "My Old Kentucky Home" inscribed on it. Not just any old Kentucky home, but the very same old Kentucky home which inspired the song "My Old Kentucky Home." I mention all this only in an attempt to make "Kentucky" not look like a word anymore. It also has a racehorse. Well, I assume it's a racehorse. It could just be a plain old regular horse with good bone structure and a strict fitness regimen. <b>C</b>
