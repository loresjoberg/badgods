			<span className="ratingheader">Rocket Launcher</span><br/>
			This is the ultimate tool for blowing me up. The astonishing thing is that it works equally well for other people blowing me up or for me blowing myself up. No matter what the situation or setting, if rocket launchers are involved, I end up as a greasy floor stain. One interesting thing is that you can use the rocket launcher to boost the height of your jumps if you fire it at the right angle, blowing me up in the process. <b>B</b>

			This is a gun that fires little razor-sharp Frisbee brand flying discs, which can ricochet off walls so that you can hit someone around the corner. I love that you can do these interesting things with weapons if you're not firing them rapidly in a blind panic. The information doesn't actually apply to me, but it's good to know. <b>C+</b>

			This weapon fires globs of biological material, which blow up after a few seconds, as all good biological material should. This really isn't useful for much, althogh I imagine it would help with an infestation of silverfish. If this is your only weapon, I recommend resigning yourself to a messy death and hoping you respawn near something useful. <b>D</b>

			<span className="ratingheader">Flak Cannon</span><br/>
			This is a great weapon for those with low ping rates, slow reflexes, and a desire to occasionally score a kill. The blast range is small so it's not entirely likely to turn into an assisted suicide device and it actually does decent damage, so it works well with the aforementioned blind, panicked mouse-clicking. And it leaves a bunch of shrapnel holes on the wall, so if you manage to die in the correct location, you can play "connect-the-dots" on your monitor instead of plunging back into the bloody samsara that is Unreal Tournament. <b>A-</b>

			You can use thing thing to fire a ball of energy, and then <em>shoot</em> that ball of energy with a <em>beam</em> of energy when it's near your enemy, making it blow up. Who would <em>design</em> a weapon like that in real life? That makes James Bond's most complicated gadgets look like thrown bricks by comparison. "Our soldiers will not be effective until we design a gun where you can shoot it, and then shoot the projectile you just shot to make it blow up." Yes, you can just shoot people with it regular, but it's still stupid. <b>D+</b>
