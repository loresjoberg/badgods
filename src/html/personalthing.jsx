	Hanging out in coffee shops, I overhear a lot of people receiving religious counseling. Christians, mostly, with a smattering of people who appear to be conversing with their own personal guru who is telling them some aspect of the meaning of life or another. Is this like a virtual business, where you take all your calls at Starbucks and all your faxes at FedEx? I would feel a little weird getting involved in a start-up religion. It does give deeper meaning to the term "angel investors" though.
