	Be Prepared To Defend Yourself
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img src={"/images/hobosigns-defendyourself.jpg"} width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> Yeah! Get into the Unyielding Tiger Stance! Be prepared to unleash some Bum Fu! I dunno. Hobos are probably more violent than legend would have you believe. Most subculture stereotypes of gentle, kind people are untrue; I personally know at least six ways of getting a hippie to take a swing at you, only two of which involve saying something snarky about hemp. I'm sure a great many hobos can introduce you to a world of pain, or at least leave a harmonica-shaped dent in your forehead. But still, I'm not sure what "preparing to defend yourself" would mean in this context. Maybe grabbing a stick. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

	These People Are Rich
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img src={"/images/hobosigns-rich.jpg"} width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> I have to doubt the utility of this sign. First: they clearly didn't get that way by handing cash over to hobos. Second: If the money could be easily stolen, don't you think your fellow hobo would be stealing it instead of making the sign? Thirdly: if your main mode of transportation is an unsecured boxcar, are you really in a position to decide who's rich and who's merely upper middle class? I can only see this as the hobo equivalent of small talk, followed by the sign for "Boy, I wish I was rich" and the sign for "I heard <em>that</em>." <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>

	Mean Dog Here
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img src={"/images/hobosigns-meandog.jpg"} width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> For some reason, I really like this one. Partially because it's really useful. You don't want to figure out how mean a dog is by counting the stitches. Partially because it looks like someone got distracted in the middle of making a comb and wax paper kazoo. You'd get distracted from making a comb and wax paper kazoo, too, if a mean dog was coming at you. <span className="ratinggrade">A-</span>

	Go This Way
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img src={"/images/hobosigns-thisway.jpg"} width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> It requires a great deal of trust to go along with hobo signs. How can you be sure that the sign wasn't put there by a serial killer with a new freezer and a little esoteric hobo knowledge? Really, even if it <em>is</em> another hobo you're relying on someone who may be under the influence of grain alcohol, delirium tremens, or the dreaded "Van De Kamp Fever." On the other hand, it's not like you're going to be getting a lot of useful information out of the Zagat Guide to Generous Townfolk, so you've got to go with what you've got. <span className="ratinggrade">C+</span>

	Catch a Train Here
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img src={"/images/hobosigns-train.jpg"} width="100" height="100" alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> Well, it's useful. And self-apparent. At this point, though, I'm a little sad that the sign for catching a train is just a train. I was half expecting some sort of wacky-ass drawing of a monkey wearing a bowtie, or a cross with a sprig of parsley on top. I was, as they say, expecting the unexpected. I can take comfort in the fact that at least it's not just a box with the words "Yo, catch a train here." In the great game of Extreme Pictionary that is the hobo lifestyle, some things abide. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>
