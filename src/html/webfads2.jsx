	Hampsterdance
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	The original Hampsterdance page was an excellent testament to the power of animated gifs and an inability to spell. It was also one of the first tangible signs that the Web was no longer the purview of those who put "tell computers how to be" above "laugh without spitting" on their pre-incarnation skill request form. True geeks don't care for the adorability of spastic rodents any more than they care if Todd will help Dorian get Ace back on <cite>One Life to Live</cite>. <span className="ratinggrade">D</span>

	Dancing Baby
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	The Dancing Baby was the first Internet fad to make it off the Web and into the fantasies of a fictional anorectic attorney, beating out the "juggling eggplant" sequence in <cite>Ray Aden, ADD DA</cite> by two weeks. In true Web form, the animation required a random-yet-catchy soundtrack to really hit the big time. It's hard to beat a song with the words "Ooga Chaka" in it, and I admire the restraint in not using something like "Baby Baby" or "Ice Ice Baby," but I probably would have picked Imperial March from <cite>Star Wars</cite>. But I'm like that. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

	Star Wars Kid
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Now that Warhol's prediction about fame is coming closer and closer to fruition -- the current Mean Notoriety Time is two and one-half hours, down from six hours in 1995 -- it's time to add an addendum to the effect that the fifteen minutes of fame will be followed by five years of lawsuits. Such is the case with "Star Wars Kid," a young man named Ghyslian Raza who videotaped himself pretend-lightsaber fighting with a golf ball retriever. The video ended up on the Web and he had to suffer the humiliation of millions of strangers knowing his name is "Ghyslian." Legal briefs have been filed, but no amount of suing is going to prevent this sort of thing. In the future, your only recourse will be to never do anything dorky. Good luck! <span className="ratinggrade">B</span>

	Frog in a Blender
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	It's hard to define this objectively, especially since I'm dedicated to the idea of no research whatsoever, but it seems to me that Frog in a Blender was the first massively popular Flash diversion. Presumably millions of people longed to torture and kill profane amphibians, and aside from a few lucky exorcists in the middle ages who got to take on possessed newts, they were unable to fulfill their needs until Macromedia came around. Beats hell out of yet another Pong clone. I guess. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

	Domo-Kun
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Fame is fickle. In one country you're a beloved television star, and in another you're an incomprehensible anti-masturbation spokesman. Such is the fate of Domo-Kun, a bizarre little Japanese character a friend of mine described as "a spam creature," who entered American consciousness via a graphic explaining that every time you masturbate, God kills a kitten. Why God would choose a fuzzy toothy stop-motion cartoon character as the agent of His righteous-yet-obliquely-directed wrath is never adequately explained, but the picture came from Fark, and they never explain anything. Adequate explanations are so rare at Fark as to make Mary Poppins look like the information desk at the New York Public Library. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>
