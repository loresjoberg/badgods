<p>
			Good name! Much better than "Humility Bar" or "Reasonable Self-Assessment Bites." The candy itself, however, needs to get a grip and face reality. You'd imagine that wads of chocolate holding little wafers in a smothering embrace would be good, but then you'd be imagining higher-quality chocolate. <b>C-</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Some Variety of Happy Face Candies</h3>
<p>
			Okay, think flat M and Ms, only without the lettering. Instead, the yellow ones have happy faces printed on them. But only the yellow ones. And they have this kind of fruity flavor to them. It's very strange. Anyhow, I think devouring happy faces will be much more appealing once they perfect that "screaming candy" they've been working on. <b>B</b>

<p>
			I call this "Marshmallow Head" not because there's any evidence that that's what it's actually called, but because of the horrid, malformed, twitching, spandex-wearing mockery of cartooning on the package. The half-strawberry (divided lengthwise) marshmallows on the inside are reasonably tasty, but putting Marshmallow Head on the outside is like putting Cerberus at the gates. He disturbs me. I want to stop talking about him now. <b>C</b>

<p>
			Foreign snacks, I've discovered, tend to taste different even when they're the close equivalent of something available opposite People magazine at a check-out line near you. These individually-wrapped travelers, for instance, are just fruit chews, not unlike Starburst without the right angles. But there's something about them that's very different, the bouquet of a subtly different blend of preservatives or something. Maybe it's just the taste of strict rabbinical oversight. <b>C+</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Chocolate Hazelnut Bar</h3>
<p>
			Hazelnut is, to my way of thinking, a vastly underused flavor. Outside of Nutella, Frangelico, and those weird flavored creamer packets it's often ignored in favor of generic "nougat." Anyhow, this tasty glucose unit uses hazelnut to good effect. And it's made in Nazereth! Delicious and historically significant, what more could you ask for? <b>A</b>
