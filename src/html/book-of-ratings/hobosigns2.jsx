<p className="ratingbody">
	<img className={"ratingsImage"} src={"/images/book-of-ratings/hobosigns-kindlady.jpg"} alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> Well, a cat makes sense. Cats and kind ladies are typically found in close proximity. Rarely do you hear some gentle matron saying "Oh, you poor dear. Come on in and have a seat, I'll get you a slice of OH CHRIST IT'S A CAT YOU FUCKING LITTLE ASS-LICKING VERMIN I'LL CUT OFF YOUR TAIL AND SHOVE IT DOWN YOUR THROAT THAT'S RIGHT RUN YOU FUZZY PRICK rhubarb pie and some tea how does that sound?" Also, if you're going to mar a kind lady's mailbox post, I'm sure she'd appreciate a little drawing of a cat more than some arrowhead-looking thing. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">There Are Thieves About</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img className={"ratingsImage"} src={"/images/book-of-ratings/hobosigns-thieves.jpg"} alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> It's a bit startling to see numbers in a hobo sign, let alone unreduced fractions. I can only assume that "2/10" has some incredibly clever significance that only the hobo mind can appreciate in its entirety. I checked the Bible, and the closest I could come has Hosea 2:10, which reads "And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand." Which has nothing to do with hobos or thieves, but trust me, it's one of the more interesting options. <span className="ratinggrade">C-</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">A Doctor Lives Here. He Won't Charge You.</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img className={"ratingsImage"} src={"/images/book-of-ratings/hobosigns-doctor.jpg"} alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> I haven't been able to track down the symbol for "A doctor lives here, he charges four cans of beans and a cigar butt" which presumably would be the next-best option. I wonder if newbie hobos sometimes get all whiny if it turns out the doctor was just feeling generous with the hobo who made the sign, and try to convince the doctor that it's really unfair to charge when a random scratching outside his house says he won't. I also wonder if the phrase "newbie hobo" has ever been typed before in the history of time. <span className="ratinggrade">C+</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">This Area Ruined By Hobos</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img className={"ratingsImage"} src={"/images/book-of-ratings/hobosigns-ruined.jpg"} alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> I am left to imagine how hobos ruin things for other hobos. I'd like to think that it's kind of like an independent music scene, with hobos getting all huffy because this new batch of hobo wannabes just got into hobodom because they saw it in some Adam Sandler film and thought it was cool and they just don't understand what it <em>means</em> to be a hobo, man. But it's probably just due to limited hobo resources such as unguarded windowsill pies, top hats with the lid kind of torn and sticking out, and people who are willing to listen to another rendition of "Big Rock Candy Mountain" without throwing things. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Keep Quiet</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	<img className={"ratingsImage"} src={"/images/book-of-ratings/hobosigns-quiet.jpg"} alt="[Sign]" border="0" align="left"/> If you're going to have to pay attention to random signs telling you to keep quiet, you may as well give up being a hobo and go back to being a tramp, transient, or bum. I'm also annoyed by the lack of specificity here. There are hobo signs for "mean dog" and "man with gun," you'd think there would be signs for "sleeping baby and irritable mother with gun," "librarian with gun," and "voice-activated gun" so you wouldn't have to wonder why you're being quiet. <span className="ratinggrade">D</span>
