<p className="ratingbody">
	The problems with a boxing glove on an arrow shaft are legion. There's the issue of aerodynamics, there's the general preciousness of hitting someone with a flying boxing glove, but the real problem is this: where does the hero keep it? Superhero quivers are typically sleek and streamlined, with no visible room for contrived clownlike armaments. I admit that this is a minor point of disbelief compared to flying men from doomed planets, but it still chafes me like cardboard overalls. <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Boomerang Arrow</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Comic book boomerangs, rather than being just sticks with a vague tendency to curve around, are nearly supernatural items with an ability to return where they started no matter what happens. They can bounce off the interestingly ridged skulls of alien conquerors, latch onto weapons or jewelry, or run off to the bar for a quick Jack and Coke, and yet still return to the waiting hand of whatever costumed goon threw it. The boomerang arrow is basically the same thing, only rather than simply ignoring physics, it drags physics home, chains it up in the crawlspace, and feeds it cockroaches and detached pigeon toes. <span className="ratinggrade">C-</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Net Arrow</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	It seems like a lot of trouble to adapt a remarkably effective killing tool into an essentially harmless device for capturing and rehabilitating the criminally inclined. If you don't want to hurt the enemy, why not start out with something basically harmless to begin with, like a snow globe or an office chair? But no, they've got to go with the arrows, leading to this odd device that somehow manages to sense the precise moment when it's passing over fleeing ruffians, capturing them like a daddy longlegs under the glass tumbler of a soft-hearted housewife. <span className="ratinggrade">C+</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Explosive Arrow</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Now we're talking. I'm not saying I want exploding dismembered bodies flying around my comic books -- although I'm sure the market is out there -- I'm just saying that part of the fun is knowing that the superhero in question <em>could</em> reduce your basic jewel thief to ruffian pat&eacute;, but doesn't out of a sense of personal honor and a lingering nostalgia for the Comics Code. So even if explosive arrows end up being used solely on walls and robot drones, I'm glad to know they're there. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>

<h3 className="ratingsHeader">Drill Arrow</h3>
<p className="ratingbody">
	This fits into the category of "arrows that really don't need to be arrows." There's precious little call for long-distance carpentry. Most people who need to make a birdhouse or a replica colonial rocking chair or something are pretty content to actually be next to the item they're drilling. I'm sure there are some situations where Green Arrow really needed to drill from a distance, but there were also times when it was really handy that Aquaman could tell tuna what to do. The word is "contrived." <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>
