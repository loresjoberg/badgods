<p>
			Lucky has reason to be happy, in spite of the fashion faux pas of a spiked collar in fire-engine red. Being of similar dimensions as the rest of the family, he has attained equal status. He fits on the merry-go-round! He can sit behind the desk! He can <em>drive the ambulance</em>! If the real world were more like the Fisher-Price world, we'd have happier dogs and more people bleeding to death on the freeway asphalt. <b>B+</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">The Father</h3>
<p>
			I'm guessing on the relationships among the Little People, here. It's not like you can check for a wedding ring. At any rate, The Standard Fisher-Price Little Adult Male Person apparently went to the Charlie Brown Beauty College for all his haircuts. But he seems to be happy with his lot; wife, children, plastic car with circular depressions for seats. It's all a Fisher-Price Person could ask for. <b>C</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">The Upset Freckled Boy Child</h3>
<p>
			It's nice of Fisher-Price to include a dissident among all the smiling Little Constantly Happy People. A dissident with his hat on sideways, so you <em>know</em> he's trouble. He's unquestionably the sort of hard-hearted delinquent who steals apples from Old Man Croody's yard and says "Nuts to you!" to authority figures. I like him. <b>A</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">The Mother</h3>
<p>
			Mom's freaky. Her eyes are always closed, and her mouth is always open, like some sort of deformed baby bird. Maybe the open mouth is supposed to be a smile, but in that case she has pink teeth, which is its own set of problems. Combine that with a stern German headmistress hairdo, and you've got one unnerving hausfrau. Also she has no nose. <b>D+</b>

		<h3 className="ratingsHeader">The Little Girl</h3>
<p>
			Continuing with the Aryan theme of the distaff portion of the Little People world, the little girl seems to be going for a "Heidi of the Non-Toxic Plastic Alps" look, what with her milkmaid braids and the cute little ruff between her head and thorax. No doubt once she reaches puberty her nose will fall off and her eyes will glue shut and she'll end up just like dear old mom. She may build a cocoon first, I'm not sure. <b>C-</b>
