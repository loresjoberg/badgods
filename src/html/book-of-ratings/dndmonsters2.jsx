			It's this big, owlish, bearish thing. Big deal. I can play that game too. "Watch out for the hawklion! Beware the vulturetiger! Don't worry too much about the sparrowspaniel!" The <cite>Monster Manual</cite> says that this beastie is "probably the result of genetic experimentation by some insane wizard." Insane wizards are an important part of the D&D economy, keeping inefficiently-designed catacombs stocked, adventurers busy, and dealers in magic items happy. Kind of like the WPA, only with bushier eyebrows. <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>

			Gygax clearly had some sort of ooze fixation. He populated his little world with a goobery panapoly of spores, molds, and fungi, at least one variety of which has psychic powers. Huh. At any rate, closely edging out green slime for "Best Performance by a Nickelodeon Game Show Prop" is the gelatinous cube, a transparent, hallway-shaped, flesh-dissolving, uh. Cube. The sheer ridiculousness of it is impressive. Here we have yet another monster with no reason to exist in a dungeon-free ecosystem. It's genetically adapted to <em>graph paper</em>, for God's sake! Plus it conveniently fails to either digest or excrete metal, giving an adventurers a reason to kill it and scoop coins from its corpse. It's like some sort of living, deadly, mall fountain. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>

			Like the aforementioned cube, this is yet another monster perfectly adapted to life in a dungeon. The whole deal is that it looks like a floor, but eats you like a monster. It's like the world's most boring Transformer. The odd evolution of D&D monsters leads me to conclude that one of the following must be true: dungeons have existed for at least fifty million years <em>or</em> there's some sort of hyperspeed Lamarckian evolution going on <em>or</em> evil wizards routinely make new monsters to relax and impress waitresses <em>or</em> hey, are those nachos? Can I have some? <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>

			It's amazing what you can come up with using a thesaurus and a box of 128 Crayolas. I'm just sorry the Burnt Sienna Leviathan didn't make the cut. The umber hulk looks like a cross between a stag beetle and Jesse Ventura (or, in more recent incarnations, a cross between an African harvester termite and Crispin Glover): a big bipedal insect with those weird insect clampy jaws and claws and fingers and bleh. It has the power to confuse onlookers, which is a power more D&D monsters should have. "So this is, what? A perfectly round bird with five legs? I don't get it. What kind of monster is OW MY HIT POINTS!" <span className="ratinggrade">B</span>

		<p className="ratingbody">
			One reason that D&D is better than video games based on D&D is that in the tabletop version mimics sometimes disguise themselves as something other than chests. Computer roleplaying games often have mimics--imitation mimics, if you can wrap your head around that--which are <em>always</em> disguised as chests. Chest chest chest. It makes you wish that digital orcs would stick their electrum pieces in a foot locker or some variety of credenza, just to break the ennui of another piratey-looking wooden chest suddenly sprouting limbs and beating you to within an inch of your save file. It would be refreshing like the breezes of summer to be able to say "Hey! I just had my clavicle shattered by an aluminum tool shed!" <span className="ratinggrade">B-</span>
