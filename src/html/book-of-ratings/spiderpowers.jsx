<p>
			Yay for the spider-webbing. I don't care if the web shooters are mechanical, biological, or made of actual live spiders wrapped around the wrist, it's the slinging and swinging that makes Spider-Man the superhero he is. Also, they pretty much nail him as a New York superhero, thanks to the abundance of tall buildings. If Spider-Man were based in, say, Durham, North Carolina, he'd be limited to fighting crime in about five blocks of the downtown area. <b>A-</b>

			I'm not understanding this whole "proportional" thing anyway. There are genes and/or radioactive substances that can just bypass the whole square-cube law? Without even giving Pete an exoskeleton? Actually, I don't care. I'd no sooner apply science to a Marvel comic book than I'd start lecturing Charles Schultz's corpse on anatomy, but I love to invoke the square-cube law. <b>C+</b>

<p>
			The proportional speed of a spider isn't really that impressive. Watching those buggers run, I'd guess about ten or fifteen scale miles per hour, tops. I guess Spidey uses his speed mostly to dodge attacks, and it's hard to say how well a spider would do getting out of the way of a little tiny miniature pumpkin bomb. There should be a villain who traps Spider-Man under a giant glass tumbler, sticks a giant issue of National Geographic underneath him, then puts him outside. That'd show him! <b>C-</b>

<p>
			I wish <em>I</em> had Spider Sense. (The proportional sense of a spider!) I rarely get into fights, either with school bullies or world-conquering sociopaths, so it'd be limited to flashes of intuition like "don't order the lamb" or "you're holding that screwdriver in a really stupid manner," but TELL me that wouldn't be handy! I'd know when not to order the lamb! <b>A</b>

<p>
			You know what I love? In the comics or the extremely slow-paced comic strip, whenever Parker's in his civilian identity but needs to climb up a wall nonetheless, he takes his shoes off! That's attention to detail! Even if you've been bitten by an irradiated arachnid, you can't climb walls with your shoes on! Don't be silly! That's the sort of quality control that made Marvel a publishing giant except between the years 1993 and 2000. <b>B</b>
