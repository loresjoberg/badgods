			As far as I know, the idea of a six-legged panther with squid tentacles that looks like it's somewhere other than it really is originated in the mind of D&D creator E. Gary Gygax, possibly as the result of blunt trauma. Not that I'm complaining. The displacer beast is an excellent example of synergy; a panther with squid parts is considerably more intimidating than a squid strapped to a panther. My main complaint with the name. Not only is it alarmingly prosaic, shouldn't it be called a "displacing beast"? We don't call flying fish "flyer fish." We don't refer to the Ukrainian burrowing elk as a "Ukrainian burrower elk." On the other hand we do have leafcutter ants and nipple-kisser voles, but it just sounds wrong to me. <span className="ratinggrade">B+</span>

		<p className="ratingbody">
			The biggest disappointment in the D&D movie (a phrase equivalent to "the dustiest end table in Pompeii") was the five seconds of CGI beholder action in which this eleven hit-die aberration is fooled by the old "throw a pebble" trick. <em>Ooh,</em> I'm angry. Beholders are <em>much</em> cooler than that. Their array of eyes is a veritable snack machine of doom, provided said snack machine was stocked with <em>deadly magic rays</em>. And Funyuns. Gotta have Funyuns. Add to that skin that made "chitinous plates" a household name, the ability to fly, and a standard-issue toothy maw and you've got experience points that you've got to earn the fuck out of. <span className="ratinggrade">A+</span>

			I have to admit, this is pretty funny. Anything that can render an adventurer's +3 agnostic sword of oozebane into so much mucus-coagulating dust is good for a laugh or two. The problem is that the thing is pretty distinctive what with the propeller tail and the antennae and all, so the adventurer in question just pulls out a bow and keeps his distance. Yeah, you could argue that the characters shouldn't act on player knowledge, but I find it hard to imagine that the paladin's wise mentor never mentioned that if you come up against a big propeller-bug thing, it's time to hand your page a big stick and send him in. Seems like that'd be high on the curriculum. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

			These intelligent, teleporting, other-dimensional fox terriers are the natural enemies of displacer beasts. I love that Gygax had this whole magic-spewing ecosystem going on. Of <em>course</em> blink dogs are the natural enemies of displacer beasts! And esophagus monsters feed on the tender leaves of the rare-but-majestic elf ficus! It <em>all fits together</em>! Anyhow, blink dogs are chaotic good, which means that they're one of the few creatures in the Monster Manual that don't exist solely to guard treasure and draw blood. Instead they can aid the party, provide information, and look really surprised when you kill them to search their spleen for emeralds. <span className="ratinggrade">C-</span>

		<p className="ratingbody">
			I complain about the boring descriptive names of D&D monsters, but if this is the alternative, it's just as well. "Githyanki" sounds like one of those midwestern lake names that means "the place those white people keep asking about" in Pawnee. The githyanki (plural, "whole bunch of githyanki") live on the Astral Plane, which is a place adventurers can go when they've completely wrecked the economy of their home world by flooding it with gold and portable holes. They often have silver swords that can cut the magical cord binding astrally projected creatures to their home dimensions, which I'm led to understand in badass. This is entirely mitigated by the fact that they look like angry, emaciated Smurfs. <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>
