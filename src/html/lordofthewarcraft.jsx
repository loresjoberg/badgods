		Pudwhacker lead Fishburp to the Council chambers and there he found Furioso and several others that were seated in silence about him. Fishburp saw Bucketboozer and Dishwater; and in a corner alone Studmost was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes. Furioso drew Fishburp to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company.

		'Here, my friends, is the hobbit, Fishburp son of Drunktank. Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.'

		He then pointed out and named those whom Fishburp had not met before. There was a younger dwarf at Dishwater's side: his son Chicknwaffls. Beside Bucketboozer there were several other counsellors of Furioso's household, of whom Hotgirls was the chief; and with him was Tasticakes, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Cametokillu the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown, Lostdude, a messenger from his father, Roxyrooroo, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.

		He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Fishburp and Psychocutie with sudden wonder.

		'Here,' said Furioso, turning to Pudwhacker, 'is Bankbooty, a man from the South."
