	Handcuff Arrow
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Oh, come now. The guy already has a net arrow, a bola arrow, and a glue arrow. He's got more ways to tie people up than a rodeo dominatrix. Adding an arrow that's specifically designed to limit the movement of people who already happen to have their wrists close together, that's just silly. I dunno, maybe he just likes to keep useful items on the ends of arrows. Maybe he has an arrow with his car keys on the end, and a "change of socks" arrow. Clearly, the guy likes arrows. <span className="ratinggrade">D</span>

	Extinguisher Arrow
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Okay, I gotta give him this one. That's pretty cool, and useful. A fire isn't something you want to snuggle up to, so the distance thing is there. And the operation requires only the tiniest bit of suspension of disbelief. As an added bonus, it actually serves a reasonable purpose, for a gritty, street-level hero like Green Arrow. He was always saving illiterate ghetto preachers from flaming drug dealers. Stuff like that. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>

	Smokescreen Arrow
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	You'd think that if someone expected to have to hide a lot, his first step would be to not dress in green tights and grow a melodramatic goatee. Batman at least has the sense to dress in muted greys and navys. This is another one of those arrows where you wonder why it has to be an arrow. Why would you need to create a smokescreen over there? If the bad guys are over there, you don't need a smokescreen, you already got away. It's like he wants to be the world's first long-distance ninja. <span className="ratinggrade">C</span>

	Grappling Hook Arrow
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Once you've been looking over some of the silly-ass arrows superheroes stock, a grappling hook arrow starts to look downright plausible. Sensible, even. You start to wonder why <em>you</em> don't have one. Seems like a logical thing to carry around, in case you need to scale a wall. Like if you get unjustly sent to an extremely minimum security prison, the sort where they don't take away any archery equipment you have on you. Spend a half hour trying to figure out what you do with a drill arrow, and that scenario starts to look pretty likely. <span className="ratinggrade">B+</span>

	Sonic Arrow
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	I love how in old comics, the superheroes will bust out with some sort of sonic device that has the bad guys doing their best Edvard Munch impressions. They always make some comment like "Luckily, my earplugs will protect me from the effect!" This is hilarious. First, you rarely see them putting in the earplugs or taking them out, much less getting run over by an ice cream truck they failed to hear. Secondly, I love how they make these comments to nobody in particular. It's like eating a bunch of Chinese food then remarking out loud "Luckily, my small intestine will extract the nutrients from that meal!" <span className="ratinggrade">C+</span>
