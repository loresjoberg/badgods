	Mahir

<p className="ratingbody">
	Ah, an artifact from those halcyon days where inexplicable, poorly-written attempts to get laid via the web were a <em>novelty</em>. Now you can't swing a Neopet without hitting one. You've got to give Mahir credit for riding his fame like a giant tortoise; he appeared on television shows, chatted with movie stars, and even released a single. Not a lot of credit, though, considering that at this point he ranks in celebrity somewhere below someone who kind of knows a guy who got kicked off <cite>American Idol</cite> in the first round. <span className="ratinggrade">D+</span>

	Ate My Balls
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	One important aspect of a world-class stupid Web fad is that it makes the reader say "Hey, I could do that!" When "Mr. T Ate My Balls" -- pictures of Mr. T accompanied by clumsy word balloons extolling the virtues of testicular comestibles -- first appeared on the scene, hundreds of people said "Hey, I could do that!" And they were right. The fad reached a fever point when no fewer than four "Jar-Jar Ate My Balls" sites were put up. Think of it. People actually <em>competing</em> to put up sites where <em>Jar-Jar Binks</em> is <em>eating balls</em>. <span className="ratinggrade">C-</span>

	All Your Base

<p className="ratingbody">
	The Flash animation that served as ground zero for this fad was, in essence, a convergence of four Web trends: retro video gaming, humorous Photoshopping, weird Flash music videos, and stupidity. The result, popularity-wise, was the equivalent of mixing ammonia and chlorine bleach, then throwing in nitric acid and glycerin just for fun. And yet, even after everyone's gotten a chance to get good and sick of it, it's still a pretty funny video. Especially that one soccer guy kicking that other soccer guy. <span className="ratinggrade">A</span>

	Am I Hot or Not
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	A Web fad isn't a Web fad until it has been parodied and ripped-off nigh unto death. You may think you've made something of a splash on the Web, but unless you've inspired imitators, you are nothing. You're a smudge on a boot sole. You're the sperm that took a wrong turn and ended up trying to put the moves on the cervix. By that standard, "Am I Hot or Not" earned its fad wings in a big way, leading people to rate things from cute kittens to dewy breasts. And, because someone always has to be recursive, the now-defunct "Am I 'Am I Hot or Not' or Not?" <span className="ratinggrade">C+</span>

	Bert is Evil
</p>
<p className="ratingbody">
	Well. It's a bunch of pictures of unpleasant things, ranging from Nazi Germany to the set of <cite>Titanic</cite>, with Bert Photoshopped into them. The greatest thing about this site is that someone in Bangladesh grabbed a picture of Bert with Osama Bin Laden and inserted it into a political protest poster. So you have news photos in which Bin Laden appears to have gained the support and companionship of an angry Muppet. The poster maker claimed to know nothing of this "Bert" character, but as a general rule, if an international criminal is depicted next to a soft toy, it's not intended as a compliment. <span className="ratinggrade">B</span>
